"A Girl Called Cerveza" (2012)

1. Rapid Fire (A Tyrant's Elegy)

I'm a dictator of the old school
I love my power and I love to rule
Just like my father I play the game
Of sheer oppression and rising my fame

Lately protesters
Brought riots to my streets
Demanding free elections
For rights and truth a warranty
Traitors! Deserters!
Who do they think they are?
I'll send them army forces
Because I am the only law!
The only law!
The law!
The only law!

God bless my glorious nation
(Glorious nation)
God bless especially me

So what? So what?
I'm addicted to dictate
Reforms you will never see
(You will never see)

Rapid Fire!
Shoot the liars!
Rapid Fire!
Send them to hell!
Rapid Fire!
Tanks and snipers!
Rapid Fire!
Rapid Fire! Shoot the liars!

Torture? And prison?
All propaganda lies!
To harm my reputation
In overseas I have my spies
UNO embargo?
I piss on politics!
I piss on all those sanctions
They'll get to know my dirty tricks!
My dirty tricks!
My tricks!
My dirty tricks!

God bless my glorious nation
(Glorious nation)
God bless especially me

So what? So what?
I'm addicted to dictate
Reforms you will never see
(You will never see)

Rapid Fire!
Shoot the liars!
Rapid Fire!
Send them to hell!
Rapid Fire!
Tanks and snipers!
Rapid Fire!
Rapid Fire! Shoot the liars!

I'm a dictator of the old school
I love my power and I love to rule
Just like my father I play the game
Of sheer oppression and rising my fame

God bless my glorious nation
(Glorious nation)
God bless especially me

So what? So what?
I'm addicted to dictate
Reforms you will never see
(You will never see)

Rapid Fire!
Shoot the liars!
Rapid Fire!
Send them to hell!
Rapid Fire!
Tanks and snipers!
Rapid Fire!
Rapid Fire! Shoot the liars!

Rapid Fire!
Shoot the liars!
Rapid Fire!
Send them to hell!
Rapid Fire!
Tanks and snipers!
Rapid Fire!
Rapid Fire! Shoot the liars!
Shoot the liars!


2. A Girl Called Cerveza

Yesterday I met her
The woman of my dreams
She looked so fine
Through bottles of cheap wine
Soon we drank together
The pub was my heaven
I took her home
Then? I don't know

Next day I woke at noon
She must have drugged my drink
My beer supplies were gone
That girl stole everything

I screamed!
I cried!
Her love was just a lie!

A girl called cerveza
Is trying to cheat ya
Is trying to trick ya
A girl called cerveza

A girl called cerveza
Is trying to fool ya
Is trying to dupe ya
A girl called cerveza

Told the cops my story
They already know her
She's been accused
Of beer theft and brain wash
Got no distinct features
Her mug shots are shocking
Girl of ill fame
Fraud is her game

Her file is overlong
Rogue's gallery top ten
In case I track her down
I'll fall for her again (oh, no)

I screamed!
I cried!
Her love was just a lie!

A girl called cerveza
Is trying to cheat ya

Is trying to cheat ya (cheat ya)

A girl called cerveza (kiss you...)

A girl called cerveza
Is trying to fool ya (I love beer, babe)
Is trying to dupe ya (I love you)
A girl called cerveza, cerveza


3. Witchhunt 2.0

I pull the knot and the rope around my neck
I feel the sweat that is running down my back
Is this the way how my life is gonna end?
A tragedy caused by them, my so-called friends

I once was a person
Much-loved and esteemed
But then I was slandered
Disgraced downright mean

Somebody clamed "He's a pervert!" on the blog
Soon others wrote "He likes young boys and long cocks!"
The message board put me in the pillory
Lies over lies from the net-community

Witch-hunt 2.0
The web's a battlefield
Witch-hunt 2.0
A game with no rules
Witch-hunt 2.0
No liability
Witch-hunt 2.0
Anonymous, cruel

No tolerance for cyber-bullying
To ruin a reputation's no fun at all
You, you and you! Keep up the fighting!
Go fight the defamation or fairness fall

I live my life, left the misery behind
My strenght has grown, I'm no more a MySpace-Clown
A smear campaign isn't worth a suicide
Those backers cry, cause the law has track them down

I once was a person
Much-loved and esteemed
But then I was slandered
Disgraced downright mean

I pull the knot and the rope around my neck
I feel the sweat that is running down my back
Is this the way how my life is gonna end?
A tragedy caused by them, my so-called friends

Welcome to the biggest freak show
That the world has ever seen
Sex affairs, lies and eyewash
Welcome to the primaries

The global warming
Nowhere to be found
Where facts don't matter
And delusions count

Gaffes and brain-freezes in public
Circus clowns f?r candidates?
Piling up disgracing moments
Howlers in TV debates

Voters are the only losers
Trusting in those hypocrites
Double Standard? Lower taxes?
Think again and use your wits

The global warming
Nowhere to be found
Where facts don't matter
And delusions count

Arguing whose wife's the finest
Promising moon-colonies
Are these people kinda bonkers?
Sameone help the Grand Old "P"

5. The Metal Lady Boy

I swear you
Eternal love
Please hear me
You're the only one
When I kiss you
I'm in heaven. Babe
And my heart
Stands in burning flames

Since the first day I met you
It was all up with me
Your lips as red as roses
Your skin so soft and sweet
I saw you in that nightclub

Best dancer on the pale
Later we drank and partied
Had too much alcohol

Don't mind my gender
She said to me
I'll show yoo wonders
You won't believe!

We thrashed until the morning
And then you took me home
You set my heart on fire
Male body. female soul

My beauty of Thailand
I'll be your handsome toy
Let me be your goddess
Your Metal Ladyboy
Transgender of Thailand
You are my sweet Kathoey
I'll touch you, l'll please you
My Metal Ladybay

I swear you
Eternal love
Please hear me
You're the only one
When I kiss you
I'm in heaven. Babe
And my heart
Stands in burning flames

Rocking the town together
Our romance is for real
Loud music, beer and concerts
Your neck is made of steel
To my surprise you once were
A famous Superstar
Big idol in your country
A fearsome kickboxer

Don't mind my gender
She said to me
I'll show yoo wonders
You won't believe!

We thrashed until the morning
And then you took me home
You set my heart on fire
Male body female soul

My beauty of Thailand
I'll be your handsome toy
Let me be your goddess
Your Metal Ladyboy
Transgender of Thailand
You are my sweet Kathoey
I'll touch you, l'll please you
My Metal Ladybay

Rocking the town together
Our romance is for real
Loud music, beer and concerts
Your neck is made of steel

My beauty of Thailand
I'll be your handsome toy
Let me be your goddess
Your Metal Ladyboy
Transgender of Thailand
You are my sweet Kathoey
I'll touch you, l'll please you

I swear you
Eternal love
Please hear me
You're the only one
When I kiss you
I'm in heaven. Babe
And my heart
Stands in burning flames

We thrashed until the morning
And then you took me home
You set my heart on fire
Male body female soul


6. Not One Day Dead (But One Day Mad)

Back in the days of early metal
In '82 we formed to stay
First under "Vortex" and "Avenger"
In "Tankard" then we found our way

We found our way
And still we play
From the first day
We're on our way

Even in times
When thrash exhausted
When fame was gone
We held the flag up high

We burn
Burn like fire
We thrash
Thrashing higher
Until we go mad

We burn
Burn like fire
We thrash
Thrashing higher
Not one day been dead

After the 90's great depression
When metal limped and grunge did play
Then there was the big revival
We have never lost our way

We found our way
And still we play
From the first day
We're on our way

Never broke up
When we faced trouble
Second-rate beer
Cheap hotels, lousy gigs

We burn
Burn like fire
We thrash
Thrashing higher
Until we go mad

We burn
Burn like fire
We thrash
Thrashing higher
Not one day been dead

We're limelight hogs
Nothing can part us
No reasons for a fucking reunion

We burn
Burn like fire
We thrash
Thrashing higher
Until we go mad

We burn
Burn like fire
We thrash
Thrashing higher
Not one day been dead

But one day really fucking mad

We burn
Burn like fire
Until we go mad

We thrash
Thrashing higher
Not one day been dead


7. Son Of A Fridge

An icy wind blew the day I was born
The snow feil heavily my hopes all seemed forlorn
They threw my life into a chilling cold world
Devoid nfchances still the wheel of fortune twirled

Never! I will defy! I will fight til the day thatl die!
They say Im in a jam now I say: life's no apple pie!
Mama – a nasty mall
Daddy was a ham-acting clod
Caught up in a mental deep-freeze
I surely had to beat the adds!

Wanna be the top banana
Now I'm just a rotten egg
Cut the mustard, be the big cheese
For your crumbs I'll never beg

Desperate – what could I da?
Found that switch deep inside 'o my soul
One flick shifts my condition
Alters me frnm prey tn cnnl

That's why they call me
A Son of a fridge
Father's a freak and
My mother a bitch
Dan' mess around with
The Son of a fridge
Weird as a freak and
As mean as a bitch

Cheese it! You bloody fool!
Stand aside or I'll flick the switch
You're a beer short to a six-pack
Don't mess with the son of a fridge
Hey, girl! You look so cute!
You break my heart and I can't resist
Why do you turn away now?
Tell me why do you look so pissed?

Cause I am the top banana
Surely l'm a rotten egg
Cut the mustard, l'm the big cheese
For your crumbs I'll never beg
Freeze you! I press the key
I start trembling then I cease to move
Feels like a god-damn brain-freeze
Tricked myself, me nerdy goof

That's why they call me
A Son of a fridge
Father's a freak and
My mother a bitch
Dan' mess around with
The Son of a fridge
Weird as a freak and
As mean as a bitch

That's why they call me
A Son of a fridge
Father's a freak and
My mother a bitch
Dan' mess around with
The Son of a fridge
Weird as a freak and
As mean as a bitch

9. Metal Magnolia

I watch you – a bright burning flame
I feel you – you drive me insane
When you move like shades in the night
Unreal like a trick of the light
You touch me and I nearly come
You're stirring and all hope is gone

You're gentle as a rosebud
And you're as tough as steel
A benchmark in the chaos
An ever turning wheel

Fire at night, shadow at daylight
That's what you'll always be
Fire at night, shadow at daylight
The other side of me

You teil my friends I'm gorgeous
Get me a fresh cold beer
You chew me out at random
No chance to get it clear

My Metal Magnolia
My counterpart
My Metal Magnolia
Unpredictable
My Metal Magnolia
You counterweight my soul
But anly in my garden
Magnolia grows

You're hot when I am freezing
Say "yes!" when I say: "no!"
You're canny when I'm furious
I stop and you say: "go!"

Fire at night, shadow at daylight
That's what you'll always be
Fire at night, shadow at daylight
The other side of me

I'd really love to kick you
You're my addictive drug
My intellectual challenge
The socket for my plug

My Metal Magnolia
My counterpart
My Metal Magnolia
Unpredictable
My Metal Magnolia
You counterweight my soul
But anly in my garden
Magnolia grows

My Metal Magnolia

10. Running On Fumes

We don't need catering
Or backstage luxury
Don't need clean hotel rooms
Liquids count. basically

Don't need no party girls
Dr any drugs for free
There's just one thing we need
Liquids count, basically

Touring cities and tauring nations
We fill clubs and concert halls
But it's a trouble with our obsession
Supplies deplete – too fast, too soon

Just empty glasses
And no more beer
What a nightmare
Our primal fear

Amps are howling
The drums are pounding
Banging heads on a shaking stage

The crowd is moshing and temperature's rising
Where is the beer?!
We die of thirst!

Running an fumes
Energy's low
Relight my fire!
Running on fumes
No beer, no show
Our drinking desire!
Running on fumes
Lager must flow
Our throats are dried up!
Running on fumes
That's a no-go
Refill the tankard!

Hey promoter forget the guest-list
Cause we want a delivery
Thousands of bottles, a truckload of six-packs
Cheers to the fans!
All drinks for free!

Just empty glasses
And no more beer
What a nightmare
Our primal fear

Amps are howling
The drums are pounding
Banging heads on a shaking stage

The crowd is moshing and temperature's rising
Where is the beer?!
We die of thirst!

Running an fumes
Energy's low
