"Beast Of Bourbon" (2004)

1. Under Friendly Fire

The Yearning! For Conflict! I am a Cowboy from up 'nigh
I've got my Go Pills-I'm a Winner!
On the way up I'm gonna get high!
I'm speeding! Do I care?
Demitry orders us to fly
Amphetamines have made us Killers
Ooops! British Troops! Was that a Crime?

Bleeding and Suffering!
Descision met-Thy will is done
I don't recall much of the Mission
Carried it out-sure must've been fun
Bleeding and Suffering! Nowhere to run

Under Friendly Fire- Speeding with a Gun
Under Friendly Fire- Where's my go-pill?
Under Friendly Fire- To impress my Son
Under Friendly Fire- That's my final thrill!

I'm craving - I need some! The Dealer Doctor's on my mind!
The Pentagon wills "Pre-Flight" Dinners
To stay awake, not follow behind
I'm speeding, Do I care?
Adrenaline dictates my crime
Canadians are not the the Winners
The Ground Troops dead-I'm doing fine

Bleeding and Suffering! What has my Country done to me?
A blind Robot with lot's of Uppers
Gonna get wild and gonna kill thee
Bleeding and Suffering! Nowhere to run

The Yearning! For Conflict! I am a Cowboy from up 'nigh
I've got my Go Pills-I'm a Winner!
On the way up I'm gonna get high!
I'm speeding! Do I care?
Demitry orders us to fly
Amphetamines have made us Killers

Ooops! British Troops! Was that a Crime?
Bleeding and Suffering!
Descision met-Thy will is done
I don't recall much of the Mission
Carried it out-sure must've been fun
Bleeding and Suffering! Nowhere to run


2. Slipping From Reality

I, born into a circle
I will lose not my way
I give my best by trying
I have a lot to say

Searching! I'm trying! The fear of failure
Succeed before I die
I feel the pressure on me
I've lost my mind today

Slipping from reality
Living for the "Great Escape"
Slipping from reality
Looks like it may be too late

Lord, gonna call upon you
I need your help today
Why do you fail to answer?
I'll find another way

Searching! I'm trying! Resignation
I hold my bottle high
I feel my self-worth dying
With eyes closed and a sigh

I, born into a circle
I will lose not my way
I give my best by trying
I have a lot to say

Searching! I'm trying! The fear of failure
Succeed before I die
I feel the pressure on me
I've lost my mind today


3. Genetic Overkill

You make me angry
With all those filthy lies
"For mankind beneficial"
Is what you always say

Greedy to the backbone
Blessed be biotechnology
Consequences unknown
Money for the mega-companies
Thank you for the "false" food
Cool, that we can be your guinea-pigs

Genetic Overkill - eat shit
We all will pay the bill - legal damaged health
Genetic Overkill - that's sick
We all will pay the bill - to increase their wealth
Hey, ruthless Monsanto
Your Third World homicide
Controls them, exploits them
With crops and pesticides

Sanctions for Europe
That's what Bush has to say
But we don't want those products
Almighty U.S.A.

Greedy to the backbone
Blessed be biotechnology
Consequences unknown
Money for the mega-companies
Thank you for the "false" food
Cool, that we can be your guinea-pigs

You make me angry
With all those filthy lies
"For mankind beneficial"
Is what you always say

Greedy to the backbone
Blessed be biotechnology
Consequences unknown
Money for the mega-companies
Thank you for the "false" food
Cool, that we can be your guinea-pigs


4. Die With A Beer In Your Hand

Spitting fire, my desire
And then I will retire
After the Demons have been fought back into Hell
Howls in the Night
A Pack of Wolves surround me
Reborn in Steel, it's time to fight

Backed by the Devil
He has my Soul
Victory in the smell of Hell's Virgins
Diving in that Hole

Sword held higher - who's the Liar?
I have the Beer of Fire
We shit on all the stories that you have to tell
Stand up and fight!!
You Losers take a back seat
Tankard is back, and doin' it right

Die my Friend - Because this is the end
Make a final stand and die with a Beer in your hand
Die my Friend - Because this is the end
Make a final stand and die with a Beer in your hand

Industrifier! Thousand buyers
A mystic World for hire
Our lust for beer outweighs the Tales they fucking tell
Were in the right
Alcohol my Lightmare
Shows me the way, when is the fight?

Backed by the Devil
He has my Soul
Victory in the smell of Hell's Virgins
Diving in that Hole

Lust for Metal, cry for battle
It seems we're not in sync
Our feelings differ yet we all are doing well
We have a goal
You Bastards shall be done for
You don't drink Beer, Pussy Hole

Spitting fire, my desire
And then I will retire
After the Demons have been fought back into Hell
Howls in the Night
A Pack of Wolves surround me
Reborn in Steel, it's time to fight

Backed by the Devil
He has my Soul
Victory in the smell of Hell's Virgins
Diving in that Hole


5. The Horde

Far beyond
Mortality and flesh
In the shadows of the darkness
Beyond the final breath
Exists the other side
Eternal hate

When we die
And life and death unites
When the fabric of the cosmos
Is split and opened wide
They're crossing Rubicon
Hordes of the void

Unseen creatures
The bringers of plagues and disease
Evil spirits
Corrupting our world and our dreams
Seeding despair and fear

Burning rage of The Horde! Death from the over-yonder-space
Burning rage of The Horde! Consuming parasites
Burning rage of The Horde! Burning rage of The Horde!

Year by year
They're wiping out the peace
From the dawn of early mankind
Their violation pays
Turning us into them
Crime, blood and war

Unseen creatures
The bringers of plagues and disease
Evil spirits
Corrupting our world and our dreams
Seeding despair and fear

Far beyond
Mortality and flesh
In the shadows of the darkness
Beyond the final breath
Exists the other side
Eternal hate

Unseen creatures
The bringers of plagues and disease
Evil spirits
Corrupting our world and our dreams
Seeding despair and fear


6. Endless Pleasure

My head is light
Relieved of all the pressure
No need to fight
'Cause life is endless pleasure!

My mind is free
I found a hidden treasure
That makes me see
And life is endless pleasure

It's endless pleasure!
It's endless pleasure!

I'm rolling, I'm reeling
Scratch 'till my skin is peeling!
Cold sweat soaks all my covers
And in my bed I'm wheeling!

I'm twisting, I'm shaking,
I feel my soul is breaking!
I'm tossing and I'm turning
But still my mind keeps yearning!

I owe this shot
Powers beyond all measure
Fell like a God
My life is endless pleasure

I'm screaming, I'm crying!
My body's slowly dying!
And as my heart stops beating
Breath ceases with a sighing!

I'm safe and warm
This cold, cruel world around me
Can't do me harm
Now life is endless pleasure

Endless pleasure..........


7. Dead Men Drinking

We were the first wave
Born with a metal neck
Out on the highways
We've been to hell and back

Some may call us gone, poor motherfuckers
Little suckers, pathetic fools

Drink with class
That's why we're here, that's what we do
Always fast
Bang our heads since '82
Been blowing ears for ages
Deliver crazy shows
Our manager's a fart-freak
Choleric to the bone

We're Dead Men Drinking! Our brain cells call for help
Hygiene's a stranger to us, we're Dead Men Drinking!
We're Dead Men Drinking! Maybe delirious
But still on stage and thrashing, we're Dead Men Drinking!

Our blood is Ã„ppler
Beer-eyes and stinky breath
Zombies from Frankfurt
We died one thousand deaths

Some may call us gone, poor motherfuckers
Little suckers, pathetic fools

Drink with class
That's why we're here, that's what we do
Always fast
Bang our heads since '82
Been blowing ears for ages
Deliver crazy shows
Our manager's a fart-freak
Choleric to the bone

Drink with class
That's why we're here, that's what we do
Always fast
Bang our heads since '82
Been blowing ears for ages
Deliver crazy shows
Our manager's a fart-freak
Choleric to the bone

We were the first wave
Born with a metal neck
Out on the highways
We've been to hell and back


8. Alien Revenge

The story that's been on the news was fourteen years ago
An alien from outer space drank all my alcohol
That motherfucker disappeared, just leaving me a mental wreck
But now I'm recovered, on his brain I will shit!

Flying through eternal space
Wiping out the alien race

Die Alien Die - You stole my beer, I want it back!
Kill Alien Kill - You're going down, I'll break your neck!
Die Alien Die - Revenge is sweet, I'm on my way!
Kill Alien Kill - This green drunk bastard has to pay!

Arriving on their planet "green" I see the breweries
I pull my shining laser gun and watch those suckers flee
They stole the secrets of the brew, you drunken thieves will go to hell
Too many, they got me, I'm stranded on this world

I know now their evil plan
Chemical invasion, man!

[Chorus]

The story that's been on the news was fourteen years ago
An alien from outer space drank all my alcohol
That motherfucker disappeared, just leaving me a mental wreck
But now I'm recovered, on his brain I will shit!

Flying through eternal space
Wiping out the alien race


9. Fistful Of Love

You're a beauty, look so fine
The fairest maid I've ever seen
One single glance into your eyes
Sends shivers running down my spine

I long for you every single hour
I long for you with every draw of breath
To listen to your voice when you are gently talking
Makes me feel eternal bliss

I am of ancient manners
Believe in ancient rites
Got some old-fashioned present
For You, my love, tonight

Fistful! Fistful! Fistful of Love!
Into your poop-shoot, into your ass!
Fistful! Fistful! Fistful of Love!
An other access?
Fistful! Fistful! Fistful of Love!
Into your poop-shoot, into your ass!

You and me will last forever
I'll ever be right by your side
With tender arms I will embrace you
I will hold you through the night

I am a man with great refinement
I am a man of high esteem
Walking the way from Ivy-League to Stoneage-
It is shorter than it seems

I am of ancient manners
Believe in ancient rites
Got some old-fashioned present
For You, my love, tonight


Your gentle touch now makes me shiver
I yearn for you with all my heart
The load of Amors joyous quiver
Is cocked and ready to depart

I am a man with great refinement
I am a man of high esteem
Walking the way from Ivy-League to Stoneage-
It is shorter than it seems

I am of ancient manners
Believe in ancient rites
Got some old-fashioned present
For You, my love, tonight


10. Beyond The Pubyard

I wake up in the toilets
Stinking of alcohol
Who am I? Can't remember
Ain't sure I wanna know

The beer stains on my clothing
Revealed by neon lights
They tell me every morning
Another thirsty night

A lover of bottles I am
Been born here, grew up here, I'll die here
The stuff in the sink is my brain
My father smelled offensive
My mother was a bitch
But it was love at first drink
They practiced what they preached

Beyond the pubyard - outside I've never been
Beyond the pubyard - my world's a drinker's dream
Beyond the pubyard - I live my life in gin
Beyond, beyond, beyond, beyond, beyond the pubyard

Hey barman, you're my hero
One thousand liqueurs stock
You make some crazy money
While drinking on the job

A lover of bottles I am
Been born here, grew up here, I'll die here
The stuff in the sink is my brain
I have no use for clean air
I don't like oxygen
The cigarette smoke preserved me
Just call me Boozer Man


I have no use for clean air
I don't like oxygen
The cigarette smoke preserved me
Just call me Boozer Man
