"Vol(l)ume 14" (2010)

1. Time Warp

One month in full coma
My life destroyed by gunshots
Lost my job, lost my girl
Frustration, fading memories

Black and white, black and white
The world appears in black and white
Dragged myself through subway stations
Ripped apart by poverty

Neon sky, neon sky
I drowned beneath a neon sky
Then I heard of famous scientists
Who did look for volunteers

TIME WARP AGAIN
I HAVE TO SET THINGS RIGHT
THE NEXT TIME NO MISTAKES, MY FRIEND!
TIME WARP TONIGHT
TIME WARP AGAIN
I HAVE TO SET THINGS RIGHT
THE NEXT TIME NO MISTAKES, MY FRIEND!
TIME WARP TONIGHT

Travel back, travel back
I had the chance to travel back
Riding eight weeks down the timeline
Hyper jump into the past

Energy, Energy
My body filled with energy
I arrived but there's the problem
There is still my old-time-me

TIME WARP AGAIN
I HAVE TO SET THINGS RIGHT
THE NEXT TIME NO MISTAKES, MY FRIEND!
TIME WARP TONIGHT
TIME WARP AGAIN
I HAVE TO SET THINGS RIGHT
THE NEXT TIME NO MISTAKES, MY FRIEND!
TIME WARP TONIGHT

I brewed an evil plan
How to reclaim my world
How to get rid of me
How to regain my girl

Lay in ambush with a sniper
A bloody rifle on the roof
Fired once, fired twice
Shit I thought I shot myself

I brewed an evil plan
How to reclaim my world
How to get rid of me
How to regain my girl

Read the story in the paper
And now I realize
Caused a time-paradox, repeating
Old-time-me is still alive!

TIME WARP AGAIN
I HAVE TO SET THINGS RIGHT
THE NEXT TIME NO MISTAKES, MY FRIEND!
TIME WARP TONIGHT
TIME WARP AGAIN
I HAVE TO SET THINGS RIGHT
THE NEXT TIME NO MISTAKES, MY DEAR!
TIME WARP TONIGHT


2. Rules For Fools

There was a problem that was posed upon them
There was a riddle awaiting to be solved
They hit the stage and all they played was bullshit
They hit the stage but didn't hit a note

Think and brood on what might be the answer
Rack your brain in your struggle for the truth

So many years they pondered then they sorted it out
Too much boozing all the day before the show
So many years then they create the iron law
No more drinking on the day before the show

BUT RULES FOR FOOLS
WILL FOOL THE FOOLISH
YOU THINK YOU MADE IT
YOU FRAMED A GUIDELINE
YOU THOUGHT OF ALL NOW
BUT YOU WILL SEE

They soon played well, you saw them in the billboard
They soon played well and they reputation grew
But in the backstage no one heard them laughing
In the backstage they were feeling blue

Think and brood on what might be the answer
Rack your brain in your struggle for the truth

So many years they pondered then they sorted it out
Your will is free and that is all that life's about
So many years, then they abolished their own law
And every second show they're drinking as before

BUT RULES FOR FOOLS
WILL FOOL THE FOOLISH
YOU THINK YOU MADE IT
YOU FRAMED A GUIDELINE
YOU THOUGHT OF ALL NOW
BUT YOU WILL SEE

And when you hear them play like hell
Which show is it now, can you tell?

BUT RULES FOR FOOLS
WILL FOOL THE FOOLISH
YOU THINK YOU MADE IT
YOU FRAMED A GUIDELINE
YOU THOUGHT OF ALL NOW
BUT RULES FOR FOOLS
WILL FOOL THE FOOLISH
YOU THINK YOU MADE IT
YOU FRAMED A GUIDELINE
YOU THOUGHT OF ALL NOW
BUT YOU WILL SEE


3. Fat Snatchers

My name is Chunk and I'm a real fat ass
No diet plan could ever help me
My friends are laughing about my plump mass
Where is my dick? Long time no see

Yesterday I heard of an arcane company
A cult, maybe, that's crazy ‘bout slender body
With blood I signed a contract, a lifetime membership
Proponents call the concept "The Hippo Effect"

Check in hypnotherapy
Lose weight in coma
Check out of reality
You won't remember

FAT SNATCHERS WANT YOU ‒ THEY HAVE A SECRET PLAN
FAT SNATCHERS WATCH YOU ‒ IF YOU'RE A SUGAR FAN
FAT SNATCHERS NEED YOU ‒ YOUR POUNDS, YOUR CALORIES
FAT SNATCHERS HARVEST ‒ REDUCE YOU IN WEEKS

My name was Chunk, now it's thirty days later
I can't believe what became of me
A featherweight, a chocolate-hater
It all seems odd, I'll investigate

A country in the Third World is where the traces lead
So horrified I realize: there's nothing to eat
From all alone they're getting fat, some even look like me
I can't escape "Hippo Effect", malnourished and bony

Check in hypnotherapy
Lose weight in coma
Check out of reality
You won't remember

FAT SNATCHERS WANT YOU ‒ THEY HAVE A SECRET PLAN
FAT SNATCHERS WATCH YOU ‒ IF YOU'RE A SUGAR FAN
FAT SNATCHERS NEED YOU ‒ YOUR POUNDS, YOUR CALORIES
FAT SNATCHERS HARVEST ‒ REDUCE YOU IN WEEKS

Check in hypnotherapy
Lose weight in coma
Check out of reality
You won't remember

FAT SNATCHERS WANT YOU ‒ THEY HAVE A SECRET PLAN
FAT SNATCHERS WATCH YOU ‒ IF YOU'RE A SUGAR FAN
FAT SNATCHERS NEED YOU ‒ YOUR POUNDS, YOUR CALORIES
FAT SNATCHERS HARVEST ‒ REDUCE YOU IN WEEKS


4. Black Plague

It came from below, under the sea
No warnings, maybe a few
A natural force paired with human greed
Dragged Deepwater into the blue

The following is a textbook case
How safety systems failed
Companies play with human lives
When profits are saving the day

What do we learn from catastrophes like this?
Once there was something called "Exxon Valdez"
Workers were killed when the gas shot up
Ignited and finally explodes
A fire so bright, incredible heat
The rig sank and let the oil flow
So many species, endangered now
You've ruined the Gulf Sea of Mexico

BLACK PLAGUE ‒ THE MEANING OF "BP"
TOP KILL ‒ ALL PLANS FAILED FINALLY
BLACK PLAGUE ‒ ONE DRILL TOO MUCH, TOO DEEP
RUTHLESS ‒ ON JUDGEMENT DAY WE'LL MEET

The heads in charge downplayed the effect
"That's dangerous? We didn't know!"
Multiple tons poisoned water and coast
An oil slick out of control

What do we learn from catastrophes like this?
Once there was something called "Exxon Valdez"

It came from below, from under the sea
No warnings, maybe a few
A natural force paired with human greed
Dragged Deepwater into the blue

So many species, endangered now
You've ruined the Gulf Sea of Mexico

BLACK PLAGUE ‒ THE MEANING OF "BP"
TOP KILL ‒ ALL PLANS FAILED FINALLY
BLACK PLAGUE ‒ ONE DRILL TOO MUCH, TOO DEEP
RUTHLESS ‒ ON JUDGEMENT DAY WE'LL MEET

Shift from fossil hazards
To cleaner energies
All United Nations
Go show some unity
Stop the lobbyism
Of mega companies
Government's protection
Is what the people need

BLACK PLAGUE ‒ THE MEANING OF "BP"
TOP KILL ‒ ALL PLANS FAILED FINALLY
BLACK PLAGUE ‒ ONE DRILL TOO MUCH, TOO DEEP
RUTHLESS ‒ ON JUDGEMENT DAY WE'LL MEET
BLACK PLAGUE ‒ THE MEANING OF "BP"
TOP KILL ‒ ALL PLANS FAILED FINALLY
BLACK PLAGUE ‒ ONE DRILL TOO MUCH, TOO DEEP
YOU'RE RUTHLESS ‒ ON JUDGEMENT DAY WE'LL MEET


5. Somewhere In Nowhere

Coming from a show at the edge of the earth
Heading for the airport, still gleaming with mirth
Waiting for our homebound airplane
We had a few more tiny beers

Boarding our plane home I would shock the bourgeois
I friendly raised my fist, cheering yelled: Pa!- Pa!
Falling back into my flight seat
A distant voice is talking to me

The Gentleman might please excuse
The Pilot likes to have a word
Please take your personal stuff with you
Alas! You may not stay aboard

LOST SOMEWHERE IN NOWHERE
CAN'T MAKE MY WAY BACK HOME
LOST SOMEWHERE IN NOWHERE
I'M STRANDED ALL ALONE

First I thought:"The lady wants a baby from me!"
Our manager got nervous, he looks like E.T
Instead of falling into deep sleep
She threw me off the plane

A costly cab, expensive room, an overpriced flight
I reached my destination with delay of one night
Cuddling deep into my sofa
Again I hear the distant voices

The Gentleman might please excuse
The Pilot likes to have a word
Please take your personal stuff with you
Alas! You may not stay aboard

LOST SOMEWHERE IN NOWHERE
CAN'T MAKE MY WAY BACK HOME
LOST SOMEWHERE IN NOWHERE
I'M STRANDED ALL ALONE

The Gentleman might please excuse
The Pilot likes to have a word
Please take your personal stuff with you
Alas! You may not stay aboard

LOST SOMEWHERE IN NOWHERE
CAN'T MAKE MY WAY BACK HOME
LOST SOMEWHERE IN NOWHERE
I'M STRANDED ALL ALONE
LOST SOMEWHERE IN NOWHERE
CAN'T MAKE MY WAY BACK HOME
LOST SOMEWHERE IN NOWHERE
I'M STRANDED ALL ALONE

7. Brain Piercing Öf Death

You see me diving
Down from the stage
Where "Sting öf Metal"
Unleash their rage

Shit, what a band! They are my idols
I'm their most loyal fan
From head to toe showing their piercings
Wish I could be like them

I must pledge allegiance true
Sting öf Metal, I'll serve you
Need a piercing, real first class
Something that nobody has … Brain Piercing?!

I WANT THIS! I NEED THIS! I'LL HAVE THIS!
GIMME A BRAIN PIERCING ÖF DEATH!!!

Banging my head against the wall
Steel rings must puncture my brain once and for all

There's only one chance
To get this done
Please hear me, Dark Lord
To you I'll run

I'm travelling down (down) to visit Satan (Satan)
Open the gate of hell
In burning flames (flames) he stands before me (burn)
His sulphur I can smell

"Boy, I surely can help you"
Says the devil, grinning shrewd
"It's your soul I wanna have"
"In swap for your fame on earth" … Brain Piercing!

I WANT THIS! I NEED THIS! I'LL HAVE THIS!
GIMME A BRAIN PIERCING ÖF DEATH!!!

Banging my head against the wall
Steel rings must puncture my brain once and for all

With my new jewellery
I'm proudly back
Show Sting öf Metal
The hellish work

Jump on the stage while they are playin'
My idols give a shout (shout)
They're going nuts ‘cause of my loyalty
I'm famous, all freak out

Satan suddenly appears
But musicians know no fear!
Playin' loud like Metal Gods
Satan bursts to flesh and blood! … Brain Piercing!

I WANT THIS! I NEED THIS! I'LL HAVE THIS!
GIMME A BRAIN PIERCING ÖF DEATH!!!


8. Becks In The City

She is a Metal fan
Long hair, tattoos and piercings
She has a lot of friends
And parties in the evenings

But she's a lonely girl
No one who really loves her
Dreaming of a perfect world
With a boy who's never sober

Taking part in short meetings
For Heavy Metal skunks
One can find there someone special
Loudness-proof, deaf hardcore punks

SPEED METAL DATING!
COME IN AND FREE YOUR MIND
LOOKING FOR THE REAL THING?
MATCHMAKING FOR FREAKS
BECK'S IN THE CITY!
WHERE MEN AND WOMEN BANG ALIKE
BECK'S IN THE CITY!
YOU'LL FIND WHAT YOU SEE

Ha has stinking feet
Long hair, beer belly and bad breath
Trains his neck 'til it bleeds
Hangin' out with his friends to band heads

She meets him, he meets her
Split-second fast decision
Romance lies in the air
Fulfils their filthy visions

Taking part in short meetings
For Heavy Metal skunks
One can find there someone special
Loudness-proof, deaf hardcore punks

SPEED METAL DATING!
COME IN AND FREE YOUR MIND
LOOKING FOR THE REAL THING?
MATCHMAKING FOR FREAKS
BECK'S IN THE CITY!
WHERE MEN AND WOMEN BANG ALIKE
BECK'S IN THE CITY!
YOU'LL FIND WHAT YOU SEEK

SPEED METAL DATING!

9. Condemnation

The viewing figures will mark a new record
Tonight they have a special report
A prison escapee out on the highway
Live on air: cops, guns and blood

Thrill and suspense
Truth can be so flexible Freedom of speech
No matter if it's fact or fiction

A politician with drugs in a whorehouse
Or suicides hung in a church
An insane madman eating his own guts
Essential is what the public wants

What do we want? Headlines, sensations!
What do we want? … We yearn for …

CONDEMNATION! NEWSPAPERS AND TV-SHOWS
CONDEMNATION! NATION! UNDER MEDIA CONTROL
CONDEMNATION! YOU TUBE, TWITTER, POD CAST, BLOG
CONDEMNATION! NATION! ALL OUR DIGNITY IS LOST

A commentator is spreading just rumours
Celebrities mistreat their kids
Malicious libel in everyday life
Defamation sells and you'll buy

Thrill and suspense
Truth can be so flexible
Freedom of speech
Don't matter if it's fact or fiction

A politician with drugs in a whorehouse
Or suicides hung in a church
An insane madman eating his own guts
Essential is what the public wants

What do we want? Headlines, sensations!
What do we want? … We yearn for …

CONDEMNATION! NEWSPAPERS AND TV-SHOWS
CONDEMNATION! NATION! UNDER MEDIA CONTROL
CONDEMNATION! YOU TUBE, TWITTER, POD CAST, BLOG
CONDEMNATION! NATION! ALL OUR DIGNITY IS LOST

You're guilty in the eyes of the public
They don't care what judges say
Your honour shall be taken from you
Forever stigmatised ‒ for our pleasure

You think this is just propaganda?
That's freedom of the press, my friend!
We'll put your secrets in perspective
Expose your lousy life ‒ for our pleasure

… We yearn for …

10. Weekend Warriors

Another day spent in the treadmill
Another day stuck in work 9 to 5
Another day dreams fade away
Another day wasted from my real life

I'm stirring, I'm moving
I kindle the flame
I'm waking from my sleep
I feel my spirits rise again

I throw away my necktie
Tear off my corporate suit
I put on my old clobber
I never felt so good

We all meet at the bunker
We board our ragged, old bus
We're heading for thrash-show
Well blow the world to dust

WE ARE THE WEEKEND WARRIORS! THE WARRIORS!
WE ARE THE WEEKAND WARRIORS!
WE'RE FIGHTING FOR OUR LIVES
WE ARE THE WEEKEND WARRIORS! THE WARRIORS!
WE ARE THE WEEKEND WARRIORS!
WE'RE PLAYING TO SURVIVE

We jump into the battle
Our hearts beat thundering drums
Our veins pump heavy metal
We'll thrash ‘till kingdom come

We take with us this knowledge
Wherever we may roam

WE ARE THE WEEKEND WARRIORS! THE WARRIORS!
WE ARE THE WEEKAND WARRIORS!
WE'RE FIGHTING FOR OUR LIVES
WE ARE THE WEEKEND WARRIORS! THE WARRIORS!
WE ARE THE WEEKEND WARRIORS!
WE'RE PLAYING TO SURVIVE

Another day spent in the treadmill
Another day stuck in work 9 to 5
Another day dreams fade away
Another day wasted from my real life

I'm stirring, I'm moving
I kindle the flame
I'm waking from my sleep
I feel my spirits rise again

WE ARE THE WEEKEND WARRIORS! THE WARRIORS!
WE ARE THE WEEKAND WARRIORS!
WE'RE FIGHTING FOR OUR LIVES
WE ARE THE WEEKEND WARRIORS! THE WARRIORS!
WE ARE THE WEEKEND WARRIORS!
WE'RE PLAYING TO SURVIVE

Another day spent in the treadmill
Another day stuck in work 9 to 5
Another day dreams fade away
Another day wasted from my real life
Another day wasted from my real life
Another day wasted from my real life
Another day wasted from my real life
