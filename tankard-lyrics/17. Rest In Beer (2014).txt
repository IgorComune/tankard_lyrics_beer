"R.I.B." (2014)

1. War Cry

Allow me to introduce me
"Predator" is my given name
Sometimes even known as "Reaper"
I don't care 'bout the shady fame

By night (by night), by day (by day)
Controlled from far away

It's death I'm bringing
When rules are gone
Descending out of heaven
I am a loaded gun

War cry! War cry! Payback
War cry! When drones attack
War cry! No time to pray
Neither terrorists nor children
War cry! Will get away

As soon as I leave the hangar
Politics has clearly failed
Justice or immoral murder?
Civil death is the price we'll pay

Airstrike (airstrike), bombs fall (bombs fall)
Damage collateral

It's death I'm bringing
To Pakistan
To targets in Somalia
Also Afghanistan

War cry! War cry! Payback
War cry! When drones attack
War cry! No time to pray
Neither terrorists nor children
War cry! Will get away

War cry! War cry! Payback
War cry! When drones attack
War cry! No time to pray
Neither terrorists nor children
War cry! Will get away

Doomsday! When drones attack
War cry! No time to pray
Neither terrorists nor children
War cry! Will get away


2. Fooled By Your Guts

I know a tale that very surely must be told
Hard to believe, but certainly as true as gold
It's an enigma, an exception in mankind
Hark to my words and let the story twist your mind

There was a man who lived in the U.S.
Quite average he was, I must confess
Quite decent, fair and settled as they say
And here the story takes its course

Fooled by your guts -
They're brewing alcohol
Fooled like a klutz -
Fooled by your own brewing guts
Belly-brewed beer -
Who ever heard of that?
Belly of fear -
Fear of your own belly-beer

They found him drunk with 3,70 per mill
"I do not drink!" he swore to heaven and to hell
No one believed him until finally one day
Special doctor luckily would meet his way

They locked him in a secret hideaway
And nourished him on diet every day
Whenever he ate any kind of carbs
The story sadly took its course

Fooled by your guts -
They're brewing alcohol
Fooled like a klutz -
Fooled by your own brewing guts
Belly-brewed beer -
Who ever heard of that?
Belly of fear -
Fear of your own belly-beer

They found saccharomyces cerevisiae
Within his guts one liberating day
A fungus turning starch to alcohol
Where can I get that one?

Fooled by your guts -
They're brewing alcohol
Fooled like a klutz -
Fooled by your own brewing guts
Belly-brewed beer -
Who ever heard of that?
Belly of fear -
Fear of your own belly-beer
Fooled by your guts!


3. R.I.B. (Rest In Beer)

They call (they call) me mad (me mad)
The scientist of dread
Alas in '87
My grand invasion failed

'Bout time! New plan!
Time is ripe - evil plan!
'Bout time! New plan!
Made a deal with Satan

The Lord (the lord) of hell (of hell)
Helped my invention well

With "Bad-Brew" I will wipe out
The law of purity
Chemical world dominion
R.I.B. - rest in beer!
"My little mad professor"
Lucifer said to me
"The humans gonna suffer!"
R.I.B. - rest in beer!

Soon my (soon my) idea (idea)
Has taught mankind to fear
The impact of my "Bad-Brew's"
Infectious formula

Spread out! For free!
Spreading by drinks for free
Spread out! For free!
Purity - disappeared!

Death on (death on) the fly (the fly)
Kiss healthiness goodbye!

With "Bad-Brew" I will wipe out
The law of purity
Chemical world dominion
R.I.B. - rest in beer!
"My little mad professor"
Lucifer said to me
"The humans gonna suffer!"
R.I.B. - rest in beer!

Satan's choir:
All the mortals shall obey me!
I will drag their souls to hell
And a contract signed in toxics
Drink it up - the poisoned ale!

4. Riders Of The Doom

Bad brands rising - on mega-sales they ride
The evil corporations strive
To conquer and enslave mankind
Shackles made of profits -
In banknotes clad they fight
Their deadly smart-phone-axes kill
Our precious savings overnight

When all defenses fail
The brand-lords will prevail

Riders of the doom - ruthless tycoons!
Riders of the doom - consumers beware!
Men-in-suits-platoons -
Will march into our living rooms
No matter where you hide your funds -
Riders of the doom!

Exploitation - the lords of brands strike back
With Micro-Rough, Sam-Hung, Goo-Gal
Amass-On, Face-Hook, Barry-Black
Blood and guts will splatter - women start to cry
When Grapple swings the big i-sword
Or terror-apps force you to buy

When all defenses fail
The Brand-Lords will prevail

Riders of the doom - ruthless tycoons!
Riders of the doom - consumers beware!
Men-in-suits-platoons -
Will march into our living rooms
No matter where you hide your funds -
Riders of the doom!
Riders of the doom!

When all defenses fail
The Brand-Lords will prevail

Riders of the doom - ruthless tycoons!
Riders of the doom - consumers beware!
Men-in-suits-platoons -
Will march into our living rooms
No matter where you hide your funds -
Riders of the doom!
Riders of the doom!
Will ride into our living rooms
No matter where you hide your funds -
Riders of the doom!


5. Hope Can't Die

I heard the news last week
Rude shock! Fell to my knees
The truth feels like a stranglehold
Words of comfort seem so cold

You've always been like a brother to me
Now I'm forsaken, my heart's filled with grief
From early childhood we have been like one
Through thick and thin so sad that you're gone

Anger! Is what I'm feeling
'Bout fate and destiny
They are coldblooded bringers
Of pain and misery

Guilty! My first emotion
Am I the one to blame?
Could I have seen it coming?
My doubts turn into shame

Neither ambition
Nor good intent or lie
Will ease the sorrow
Life means death, hope can't die!
It took some courage
Until I realized
That we're all mortal
Life goes on, hope can't die!
Life goes on, hope can't die!

I saw your face last day
Palest white! Facade of clay
Wish I had the guts to act
But now it's too late your death is a fact

So, dearest friend, may you now rest in peace
I won't forget you those good memories
Here at your gravestone there is one thing I'll swear
Deep in my heart, you'll always be there

Anger! Is what I'm feeling
'Bout fate and destiny
They are coldblooded bringers
Of pain and misery

Guilty! My first emotion
Am I the one to blame?
Could I have seen it coming?
My doubts turn into shame

Neither ambition
Nor good intent or lie
Will ease the sorrow
Life means death, hope can't die!
It took some courage
Until I realized
That we're all mortal
Life goes on, hope can't die!
Life goes on, hope can't die!

Neither ambition
Nor good intent or lie
Will ease the sorrow
Life means death, hope can't die!
It took some courage
Until I realized
That we're all mortal
Life goes on, hope can't die!

Neither ambition

Will ease the sorrow
Life means death, hope can't die!
It took some courage
Until I realized
That we're all mortal
Life goes on, hope can't die!
Life goes on, hope can't die!

I heard the news last week
Rude shock! Fell to my knees
The truth feels like a stranglehold
Woods of comfort seem so cold


6. No One Hit Wonder

No one hit wonder!
We're rolling thunder
No one hit wonder!
From over yonder
No one hit wonder!
Like Knack's Sharona?
Or Teen Spirit moaner?

Meet them, those superstars
Who write a single hit
On top of all the charts
They are set for life with it

Even when fame has gone
They live in luxury
Forever pop icons
Pleasant, right? Pleasant treat!

Where is the justice
For our songs?
Cause we are Tankard!
Where the hell did we go wrong?

No one hit wonder!
We're rolling thunder
No one hit wonder!
From over yonder
No one hit wonder!
Like Knack's Sharona?
Or Teen Spirit moaner?

We played our asses off
For more than 30 yeas
But now our patience's gone
We want cash, keep the beer!!

There's only one way out
A new identity
Transgendering of course
Sex sells well, that's the key!

Where is the justice
For our songs?
Cause we are Tankard!
Where the hell did we go wrong?

No one hit wonder!
We're rolling thunder
No one hit wonder!
From over yonder
No one hit wonder!
Like Knack's Sharona?
Or Teen Spirit moaner?

No one hit wonder!
We're rolling thunder
No one hit wonder!
From over yonder
No one hit wonder!
Like Knack's Sharona?
Or Teen Spirit moaner?
No one hit wonder!


7. Breakfast For Champions

I woke up to total confusion
Could not figure out where I've been
On my tongue a dead gopher rotting
In my head throbbed a sore aching pain

Raise my spirit!
Revive my force!
Raise my fire, my desire!
Lave and light my fuse again!

I still clutched a wondrous structure
Shimmering dimly in the grey light
Stale but un-spilled, fizzyless but we
Shared one bed and we shared the night

Give me what I need today!
Breakfast for champions!
Get up in the Tankard way!
Breakfast for champions!
Liver, you will have to pay!
Breakfast for champions!
Get up in the Tankard way!
Breakfast for champions!

I compelled myself to a first kiss
Sipping gently, then taking a gush
All the colors that still were missing
Flooded my grey world with a flush

Raise my spirit!
Revive my force!
Raise my fire, my desire!
Lave and light my fuse again!

I woke up to total confusion
Could not figure out where I've been
On my tongue a dead gopher rotting
In my head throbbed a sore aching pain

Give me what I need today!
Breakfast for champions!
Get up in the Tankard way!
Breakfast for champions!
Liver, you will have to pay!
Breakfast for champions!
Get up in the Tankard way!
Breakfast for champions!

Give me what I need today!
Breakfast for champions!
Get up in the Tankard way!
Breakfast for champions!
Liver, you will have to pay!
Breakfast for champions!
Get up in the Tankard way!
Breakfast for champions!
Give me what I need today!
Breakfast for champions!
Get up in the Tankard way!
Breakfast for champions!


8. Enemy Of Order

Spying on users, attacks on privacies
The daily news are frightening
News about the agencies
Facebook is Tracebook, Google and Apple too
Structures I believed in turned out to be unsecure

You make me angry with all your shit!
You'll kill democracy and digging us a
Brave new pit
But I won't join you - I won't comply
You are the criminals - protection's just a dirty lie!

Enemy! Enemy of order!
Enemy of order! You've lost my trust!
Enemy! Enemy of order!
Enemy of order! Disclosed your bluff!

Tempora and Prism, XKeyscore, Snowden's flight
The governments deceive us, disregarding civil rights
Is this prevention or is paranoid?
Does it stop terrorism?
Are the measures justified?

You make me angry with all your shit!
You'll kill democracy and digging us a
Brave new pit
But I won't join you - I won't comply
You are the criminals - protection's just a dirty lie!

Enemy! Enemy of order!
Enemy of order! You've lost my trust!
Enemy! Enemy of order!
Enemy of order! Disclosed your bluff!

Total surveillance
No fiction, that's fact!
Is this illegal?
Hell yeah! You bet!

Enemy! Enemy of order!
Enemy of order! You've lost my trust!
Enemy! Enemy of order!
Enemy of order! Disclosed your bluff!

You make me angry with all your shit!
You'll kill democracy and digging us a
Brave new pit
But I won't join you - I won't comply
You are the criminals - protection's just a dirty lie!

Enemy! Enemy of order!
Enemy of order! You've lost my trust!
Enemy! Enemy of order!
Enemy of order! Disclosed your bluff!


9. Clockwise To Deadline

Clockwise to deadline!
Life's worthwhile - don't waste
Clockwise to the deadline!
Enjoy its sweet taste
Clockwise to deadline!
Time's ticking 'til death
Clockwise to the deadline!
Until your last breath, 'til your last breath

Born into this life
With no choice but to play our role
Bound to set the sights
On our end, the final goal

Final goal
Play your role

In old age time is running
At such a frightening pace
The years resemble minutes
Clinging to your face

Clockwise to deadline!
Life's worthwhile - don't waste
Clockwise to the deadline!
Enjoy its sweet taste
Clockwise to deadline!
Time's ticking 'til death
Clockwise to the deadline!
Until your last breath, 'til your last breath

Every single day
Reminds us of mortality
Friends may pass away
From routine yet we cannot flee

Cannot flee
Can't you see?

At last you might discover
That your plans turned to dust
So give your life a meaning
Cause your deeds will last

Clockwise to deadline!
Life's worthwhile - don't waste
Clockwise to the deadline!
Enjoy its sweet taste
Clockwise to deadline!
Time's ticking 'til death
Clockwise to the deadline!
Until your last breath, 'til your last breath

In old age time is running
At such a frightening pace
The years resemble minutes
Clinging to your face

Clockwise to deadline!
Life's worthwhile - don't waste
Clockwise to the deadline!
Enjoy its sweet taste
Clockwise to deadline!
Time's ticking 'til death
Clockwise to the deadline!
Until your last breath, 'til your last breath


10. The Party Ain't Over 'til We Say So

"Rock 'n' Rollers in wheelchairs"
That's what the headlines say
"Old geezers retire!"
Fuck off! We're here to stay!

Fuck off! We're here to stay!
Even dead we'd want to play!

No! No cause to quit!
We're kickin' butt! Butt kickin' lot!

The party ain't over 'til we say so
The party ain't over, the party ain't over
The party isn't over 'til we say so
It isn't over no!
The party ain't over 'til we say so
The party ain't over, the party ain't over
The party isn't over 'til we say so
That's what we're gonna show!

All you killjoys and moaners
We're back with amps to blast!
Bring your bottles to safety
Cause boozing is our task!

Cause boozing is our task!
Even dead we'd drink with class

Fight! It's time to fight!
Fight for your right! It's time to fight!

The party ain't over 'til we say so
The party ain't over, the party ain't over
The party isn't over 'til we say so
It isn't over no!
The party ain't over 'til we say so
The party ain't over, the party ain't over
The party isn't over 'til we say so
That's what we're gonna show!

We'll keep banging 'til the nurse comes
That's what we know for sure
Like The Stones of thrash metal
Remaining loud and pure

Remaining loud and pure!
Even dead we'd go on tour!

No! No cause to quit!
We're kickin' butt! Butt kickin' lot!

The party ain't over 'til we say so
The party ain't over, the party ain't over
The party isn't over 'til we say so
It isn't over no!
The party ain't over 'til we say so
The party ain't over, the party ain't over
The party isn't over 'til we say so
That's what we're gonna show!
It isn't over no!
That's what we're gonna show!
It isn't over no!
'til we say so!
It isn’t over no!
