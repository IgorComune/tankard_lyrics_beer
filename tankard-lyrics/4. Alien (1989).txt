"Alien" (1989)

1. Alien

It come to earth three years ago from deep in space
A brilliant U.F.O.! I could not believe it
Refuge! I let it stay with me a while
Stupid! Now I with that he would go

Alien, Alien - he's a drunkard
Alien, Alien - he ate my food

Consumed my chow 'til nothing's left every week
Are you happy now? I cannot avoid it!
Nosey! He snoops around my private stuff
Porno! And sold my stack of magazines

He broke into my well stocked fridge and drank my beer
I can't get really drunk tonight, the stores are closed
Leave now! You drive me nuts, don't want you here
Oh no! He locked the keys in his spacecraft


2. 666 Packs

We have a deal with Satan
A contract signed in Hell
We sacrifice a virgin
He makes our record sell

SATAN! - To Antichrist we pray
EVIL! - To hit the charts one day

666 Packs - Seven days of death and pain
Satan - Thirteen hours blood will rain
666 Packs - Nine black bats will eat your brain
Satan - Good with numbers? Join our cult

We have the baddest evil
Come buy our merchandise
A plastic scull, a T-Shirt
That says "I shit on Christ"

SATAN! - is thrashing to the beat
EVIL! - on seven days of week

On stage we slaughter poultry
In songs we slaughter man
Black masses, guts and torture
We do the worst we can

SATAN! EVIL! - on blood and gore we feast
SATAN! - I am your Judas Priest


3. Live To Dive

Climb on the boxes... Live to dive!
Leap into masses of sweat, beer and noise
The crazy jumper... Live to dive
Aching and hurting, but he'll never stop

You wanna hear about a freak?
A nut who dives, but not in the sea
A King Kong act, he climbs the amps
Four meter jump, cracks jokes and his bones

He drives his Benz across the roads
At rocket speed, through fog and on ice
Popping pills to stay awake
A kamikaze! He's death on four wheels

Part of a band, the worst there is
Can't even play those strings that make noise
He really thinks he's A.O.K.
Feels like a star, that guy is bad news


4. Remedy

Get out of the streets
Get out of your cage
Start thinking sharp
You got to get smart and rage
Set yourself free
Set yourself free
Good rockin' music is all we need

It's gonna save your head
Gonna save your soul
Good old fashioned
Good time remedy
They call Rock'n'Roll

Ain't no time for settin' down
You got a whole lot of noise
To make in this town
Rock'n'Roll it's goin' around
You got to pick it up and start layin' down

Don't waste my time with fancy prancing
Just Rock'n'Roll and get everybody dancin'
Take your worries out and throw then away
They make you old
They're gonna make you grey


5. (Empty) Tankard

Drinking and fucking through the whole night long
Partying with friends 'til fucking dawn
Let's go thrashin' and stagedivin'
Feel the power and sound again

We want to drink some fucking beer,
we want to drink some whiskey

Frankfurt's thrashers will rule tonight
They're well known for their bloody fight
Wodka and Cognac are our leaders
We've the best, we fuck the fuckin' rest

Empty Tankard

We have come to slamdance tonight
Bangin' and bleedin' till the fuckin' end
Playing fast and running free
Stand up maniacs, you have to fight

We want to drink some fucking beer,
we want to drink some whiskey

Liver is broken down so bloody hard
I keep on drinking until I drop
Bang your head against the fuckin' wall
Show the damned whimps who we are

Empty Tankard
