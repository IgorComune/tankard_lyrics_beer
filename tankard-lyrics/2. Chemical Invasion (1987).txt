"Chemical Invasion" (1987)

1. Total Addiction

You need your drugs - your coke your crack your pills
Blurring your money in a frenzied manner
For a losing cause that cost your life
You're such a waste - not reason, no will to live
Strung out at home for days and weeks
The daze and gloom witch stuff out your life

Let's fight! Kick it man! It sin your mind!
Shot it up! Short it up! Live it up for you
Total addiction
Smoke it up! Take it up! Live it up for you
Total addiction

Don't need your drugs - just drink some beer and mosh
It's doesn't cost much for a case of beer
As it does for a quarter or gram of cane
Listen to Tankard - you need a doze of thrash
A total addiction to those music and beer
It's reason enough to quit your drugs


2. Tantrum

I came to party with a thirst of for beer
A wanna drink, so give me one to me
My body ashes and I need one now
I'm gonna get drunk and beer is the key
It set my brew down for one second
Went to the toket - I had to peek
When I came back it wasn't very long
For me notice: My beer was gone

Tantrum - who stole my beer?
Tantrum - you must die!!!

I searched the house from
the bottom top to bottom
Checked all closets and under the couch
Came up empty it's nowhere to be found
Guess you stole it and I will kill
Is this a joke or some kind of nightmare
I want my beer and I want now
I gonna gun and know how to use it
And I will the choice is your


3. Farewell To A Slut

Coming home 6 a.m. had a night of excess
When she opened the door I puked on her dress
She says that I'm lazy - a cooser and fool
A longhaired drunkard, no good at all
She wants me to work but work makes me sick
All that I want is a cunt for my prick

You damned whore - I'm sick at all your shit
You damned whore - I'll bury you in a pit

Hell what should it do with such a bum slut
Too stupid at love, to ugly to fuck
Hiding and scolding boring all night
The longer it lasts the worse it becomes

You damned whore - I'm sick at all your shit
You damned whore - I'll bury you in a pit

She screams and complains drives me crazy all day
If she says one more word I'll blow her away
I'll cut her to pieces I'll beat her with chains
I'll dip her in acid till nothing remains
Now I'm free here in jail getting drunk on my beers
Fuckin' wardens all day for the next 20 years


4. Traitor

Death! Kill! blood will flow
From the ones who play for money
Sold! Out! It's time to pay
You're gonna die no other way

Blind! Wake up man you've got to hits
Change! Now it's time to end this shit

Make! Way! The time's at hand
To ride the world of milk metal bands
Slow! Death! The only way
A fitting end to their treacherous game

Traitor Traitor Traitor - a sonic betrayal
Traitor - it seems you've faked

You! Think! The world adores you
With your make up and silken pants
Wake! Up! You've had a nightmare
Your record didn't sell so well

Blind! Wake up man you've got to hits
Change! Now it's time to end this shit

What's! This? Demand declining
No more money in your pocket book
What! Now! Looks like it's over
Gonna throw your lipstick away

Traitor Traitor Traitor - a sonic betrayal
Traitor - it seems you've faked

You sold your soul to money
Thrash! Is what we'll play
The age of truth upon us
Beer! is what we need
We've got no pity for ya
Trash! Is what we'll play
Now death's your final payment
Mosh! It's up to you

Traitor. Liar! Loser!


5. Don't Panic

Do you care for the world we live in?
Are you aware?
Death! Kill! war's running rampant
Kill! Die! your children are dead
But there's a cause - that's what they tell us
So they lie
Off to war - inflicting terror
Millions die

Let they say: Nothing's wrong at Chernobyl
And they've found another cure for AIDS
Send their guns to Nicaragua
And shake their fingers at Afghanistan
Don't panic - it's just our world

Fatal disease killing society
Safe sex!
No! Hope! They're all drossy cured
Last! Chance! Time's running out
Russian miltdown - people dying
Is it fair?
poison clouds - water our cities
Loss of fair


6. Puke

Drink! this beer is for my health
And have a couple more
Drink! Until the beer is gone
And pass out on the floor

Puke! Puke! I drank too much
Vomit on the chair
Puke! Puke! I drank too much
Even in my hair

Drunk! The room is spinning
It's turning round and round
Drunk! My stomach let me know
As I fell to the ground


7. For A Thousand Beer

[instrumental]


8. Chemical Invasion

STOP THE CHEMICAL INVASION
German beer's among the finest
The beer is pure and chemical free
A standard set which we are proud of
A standard met by no other land
Purity laws and chemical free
No body pollution - no change!
Preservatives shall soon be common
And the beer will be bastardized

Cnemical invasion
Fight for your right to drink pure beer
Cnemical invasion
It's your right the time is here

Make a stand and try to fight it
They'll poison us with import beer
'Cause German beer - it is the purest
And there's no room for chemical here
Purity laws and chemical free
No body pollution - no change!
No loss for us - refuse to buy it
We'll rather keep our bodies clean


9. Alcohol

[Originally performed by Gang Green]

We're gonna die when the sun comes up
We'll drink until we drop
My blood's 100 proof
We're gonna stumble, twist and crawl
99 bottles of beer on the wall
I'd rather drink than fuck

No doubt about it - I can't live without it
No doubt about it - I can't live without it
Alcohol, Alcohol

It is my destiny
You got the beer
We've got the time
You got the coke - Gimme a line
We're gonna die when the sun comes up
We'll drink until we drop
I'd rather drink than fuck
You got the beer
We've got the time
You got the coke - Gimme a line
