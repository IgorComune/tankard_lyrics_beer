"Disco Destroyer" (1998)

1. Serial Killer

Here he comes, my old friend
Telling me to obey
Giving orders, I'm the slave

"The women" he whispers
"All sluts except for Mommy"
I'll kill'em all, I promise

You're gonna be bleeding for me
This is the right way can't you see?

Baby, taste my long hard knife
Gonna cut right through your life
No use running for the phone
Gonna cut you to the bone
Serial killer! Serial killer!

"Hurt her god! Hurt her bad!"
Luscious pain, fear and dread
When they die, I get so sad

Forgive me, my darling
I didn't mean to kill you
I have to swallow my sin

You're gonna be dinner for me
This is the right way can't you see?

Baby, taste my long hard knife
Gonna cut right through your life
No use running for the phone
Gonna cut you to the bone
Serial killer! Serial killer!

Why oh why, have to stop
But the voice says I must
Next time gotta keep control

"You loser, you bastard"
"You've gotta start all over"
The slaughter starts all over

She's gonna be bleeding for me
This is right way can you see?

Baby, taste my long hard knife
Gonna cut right through your life
No use running for the phone
Gonna cut you to the bone
Serial killer! Serial killer!

Broken the necks
All the humans died alone at home

Robots walk uncontrolled
Taking over, that's the goal
Circuits and steel
No more blood and no fragile bones
Weakness been killed
Machines are runnig now by their one

3. Hard Rock Dinosaur

I don't like your clubs
I don't like your drugs
Where's my whisky bar?

I don't like this beat
It ain't got no meat
Need a mean guitar!

Fuck it all! Nobody singin' my song
Nobody singin' my song
Fuck it all! Nobody bangin' alone
Nobody bangin' alone
Fuck it all!

Hard Rockin' Dinosaur
You gotta tell me where it's at
Hard Rockin' Dinosaur
This fuckin' planet cut no slack
Hard Rockin' Dinosaur
I need a heavy rockin' track

I don't dig your style
Polyester smile
Smell my leather, fool

I can't take your jive
No one here's alive
Better hot than cool

Fuck it all! Nobody singin' my song
Nobody singin' my song
Fuck it all! Nobody bangin' alone
Nobody bangin' alone
Fuck it all!

Hard Rockin' Dinosaur
You gotta tell me where it's at
Hard Rockin' Dinosaur
This fuckin' planet cut no slack
Hard Rockin' Dinosaur
I need a heavy rockin' track

Time to hit the road
Find my motherload
Cruisin' free again

Play the Ace Of Spades
This is how I made
('Cos) I'm a...

Hard Rockin' Dinosaur
You gotta tell me where it's at
Hard Rockin' Dinosaur
This fuckin' planet cut no slack
Hard Rockin' Dinosaur

4. Queen Of Hearts

The day I saw your face
I knew you were my only love
So blonde and innocent
A gift from heaven up above

I'm praying for our love
Forever I await you call
My room a temple now
A million photos on the wall

Baby I need you
The feelings that I get
I want to please you
My dreams are oh so wet

Please don't ignore me
For we must be as one
Oh can you feel me
Oh baby, here I come

Fuck all the royalty
I'm in love with the Queen of Hearts
Fuck all the millionaires
I'm in love with the Queen of Hearts
Fuck all the journalists
I'm in love with the Queen of Hearts

You are my Daily
Mirror and my Son
You are my Colour
My Star, oh you're the one

I want to be your
Royal family
Why was the music
By Elton John, not me?

They say you're dead and gone
You're livin'deep inside of me
We're lying on the beach
In Mendocino, Waikiki

They say I'm going nuts
But I will bring you back to life
I'll free you from the grave
And, darling, you will be my wife

You are my Daily
Mirror and my Son
You are my Colour
My Star, oh you're the one

I want to be your
Royal family
Why was the music
By Elton John, not me?

Fuck all the royalty
I'm in love with the Queen of Hearts
Fuck all the millionaires
I'm in love with the Queen of Hearts
Fuck all the journalists
I'm in love with the Queen of Hearts
Fuck all the rockstars
I'm in love with the Queen of Hearts


5. U-R-B

What a day, what a day, what a day, what a day
Life's great when graveyard is your home
What a day, what a day, what a day
Undead rotting bones

When we come to town
The people just keep their heads down
Trying to escape
Corpses all over the place

Maggots in my brain
Believe me, I don't feel no pain
Fingers are my tools
Bloodthirst is pretty cool

Soon you'll see, you run out of time

What a day, what a day, what a day, what a day
Life's great when graveyard is your home
What a day, what a day, what a day
Undead rotting bones

Neon nights are bright
Nobody of us saw daylight
Cannot lose our lites
No limits in the minds

Killin' just for fun
Tomorrow it will be your turn
Going straight to hell
Agony, I can tell

Soon you'll see, you run out of time

What a day, what a day, what a day, what a day
Life's great when graveyard is your home
What a day, what a day, what a day
Undead rotting bones

When we come to town
The people just keep their heads down
Trying to escape
Corpses all over the place

Maggots in my brain
Believe me, I don't feel no pain
Fingers are my tools
Bloodthirst is pretty cool

Soon you'll see, you run out of time

What a day, what a day, what a day, what a day
Life's great when graveyard is your home
What a day, what a day, what a day
Undead rotting bones


6. Mr. Superlover

Woman - how many ways can I use woman
Abuse them - verbal assault and then abuse them
They should be grateful - subservient and still be gratefull

You drive me to my concerts, I refuse to pay for trains
Complaininng's out of order, I'm your only fucking lay
Do me service or be smacked, broad, if I don't get my own way

(Hey you, I'd die for you)
I'll drive for you, my baby
I'd do it all for you
(Hey you, I'd die for you)
succomb to all your whims
if you'd just let me in

Demon - you're present in all of my nightmares
I thank god - Vodka, my friend, has been my saviour
Because you left me - mobility is gone, I'm stranded

Give me justice, I'm the mentor, you're the only one to blame
Mouth me, sugar, get a shiner, leave you for another dame
Doesn't matter, seems you lost out, thank god you are all the game

(Hey you, I'd die for you)
I'll drive for you, my baby
I'd do it all for you
(Hey you, I'd die for you)
succomb to all your whims
if you'd just let me in

Give me justice, I'm the mentor, you're the only one to blame
Mouth me, sugar, get a shiner, leave you for another dame

(Hey you, I'd die for you)
I'll drive for you, my baby
I'd do it all for you
(Hey you, I'd die for you)
succomb to all your whims
if you'd just let me in


7. Tankard Roach Motel

Cy was a New York roach
Went to JFK
Had to fly away

Cy came to Frankfurt town
Started looking round
For a home again

Found a place
A dump full of rubble, trash and mould
Air-raid pad
A wreck of heavy metal souls

Here's a chip, here's a beer back from yesteryear
Here's a condom as a snack, hey this place is whack
There's a hole in the wall for a sleeping place
There's a smelly little things in a guitar case
I'm a fan of the band, yhough they play like hell
'cause the chaos they create is my roach motel

Cy drunk a lot of beer
Metal in his ears
Made him deaf and fat

Dried junk food in the floor
Porno mags and more
This is what it's at

Party time
The band is on tour all the place is mine
Call my friends
The vermin of Frankfurt rules tonight

Here's a chip, here's a beer back from yesteryear
Here's a condom as a snack, hey this place is whack
There's a hole in the wall for a sleeping place
There's a smelly little things in a guitar case
I'm a fan of the band, yhough they play like hell
'cause the chaos they create is my roach motel

My! Insects in the drum
Olaf found the scum
Panic in the band

Die! Kill the fucking bags
Eating all our drugs
Crawling in our pants

What the hell?
I thought Geremia was my friend
Killing now!
My extermination round the band

Here's a chip, here's a beer back from yesteryear
Here's a condom as a snack, hey this place is whack
There's a hole in the wall for a sleeping place
There's a smelly little things in a guitar case
I'm a fan of the band, yhough they play like hell
'cause the chaos they create is my roach motel
Was a fan of the band, though they play like hell
Now I'm leaving for a new rockin' roach motel


8. Another Perfect Day

I went to a football game
Anticipating victory
But they where so lame

Lost the game and slipped a notch
That's when I began to drink
I was close to dying

Watch it! I've had a bad day
My team had falled and I lost the day
World, I just hate you
I did my best to follow the rules
Watch it! I've had a bad day
My team had falled and I lost the day
World, I just hate you
I did my best to follow the rules

Freeway bound, what do I see
Fifteen cops behind of me
They must know I'm wasted

They got me, balls to the wall
Took my blood, license and all
Rotting here in jail

Watch it! I've had a bad day
My team had falled and I lost the day
World, I just hate you
I did my best to follow the rules
Watch it! I've had a bad day
My team had falled and I lost the day
World, I just hate you
I did my best to follow the rules

I got home and found a note
She left me for another guy
Just piss off and die - You bitch!


9. Death By Whips

Every day and all night long
The fucking breakdancers wanna be strong
We can't hear their fucking sound
We want metal - play it loud!

Die - Hard! Death! Whips!

Metal Militia in a heaurs
Our cruelest gang on earth
Django Bullwhip is the chief
Smash the dancers on their knees

Death by whips
Kill'em hard
Death by whips
Kill'em hard

Brealdancers wanna flee
Swords and spikes to their cheeks
Metal Militia wanna headbang
It's so loud, you'll die in pain

Die - Hard! Death! Whips!

Use your bullwhips and your guns
Limb by limb, now they run
These are our greatest weapons
To slash up those fucking cretins

Death by whips
Kill'em hard
Death by whips
Kill'em hard

Every day and all night long
The fucking breakdancers wanna be strong
We can't hear their fucking sound
We want metal - play it loud!

Die - Hard! Death! Whips!

Metal Militia in a heaurs
Our cruelest gang on earth
Django Bullwhip is the chief
Smash the dancers on their knees

Death by whips
Kill'em hard
Death by whips
Kill'em hard


10. Away!

You star in all my nightmares
You make my blood run cold
You tore my life to pieces
The selfish plan unfolds

Lying! What you say is untrue
You stabbed me in the back
Is it something that I lack

Stupid! You lured me with you cunt
I lock back in the past
Should've known it would not last

Away! Away! I gonna get away
I'm beginning ti understand
Away! Away! I'm blinded by a lay
It's better to use my hand
Away! Away! I gonna get away
No bitch ever touch me again
Away! Away! I'm blinded by a lay
Love's only true between man and man

Traitor! You were my confident
But your big-mouth did the trick
That's why I can't get no chick

Over! I made a big mistake
Now I'm on the right track
And there's no more turning back

Away! Away! I gonna get away
I'm beginning ti understand
Away! Away! I'm blinded by a lay
It's better to use my hand
Away! Away! I gonna get away
No bitch ever touch me again
Away! Away! I'm blinded by a lay
Love's only true between man and man

You star in all my nightmares
You make my blood run cold
You tore my life to pieces
The selfish plan unfolds

Lying! What you say is untrue
You stabbed me in the back
Is it something that I lack

Stupid! You lured me with you cunt
I lock back in the past
Should've known it would not last

Away! Away! I gonna get away
I'm beginning ti understand
Away! Away! I'm blinded by a lay
It's better to use my hand
Away! Away! I gonna get away
No bitch ever touch me again
Away! Away! I'm blinded by a lay
Love's only true between man and man


11. Face Of The Enemy

Drugs! The Booze! My social life dies
In the name of excessive fun
Tried to escape from which I cannot hide
Almost died 'cause I'm on the run

Searching for the answer
I don't have a clue
Sinking ever further
Put the blame on you?
Time to open my eyes and see that the enemy is me

It's time to face the enmy
Is it my fault or destiny?
Confusion's got the best of me
The mirror reflects what I see
Depraved of sight, where lies the key?
Oh yeah

Liar! Betrayer! What has gone wrong?
Does my life has to end this way?
I've put the blame where doesn't belong
Shattered goals in the name of fun

Still I keep on trying
There's no end in sight
Yet I keep on lying
Is it worth the fight?
Time to open my eyes and see that the enemy is me

It's time to face the enmy
Is it my fault or destiny?
Confusion's got the best of me
The mirror reflects what I see
Depraved of sight, where lies the key?
Oh yeah

Seek - the truth! It comes from inside
Two-way street, you are not alone
All the facts which you've always denied
Are to learn from - put aside your pride

It's time to face the enmy
Is it my fault or destiny?
Confusion's got the best of me
The mirror reflects what I see
Depraved of sight, where lies the key?
Oh yeah


12. Splendid Boyz

Early in the mourning hours
We get up to begin our day
Reading letters, smelling flowers
Muscle-training, body-shave

We're lookin good, really good, yeah so good

Dirty dancing turns the girls on
Cause we can't sing anyway
Label boss says: you can't be wrong
Thake the cash, do what I say

You'll be rich, really rich, yeah so rich

Go for the money before it's gone
Take all the chances while you're stll young
Go for the money, don't wait too long
You've got the choice, my "Splendid Boys"

Pretty baby please believe us
When we sing that we love you
UH-UH-AH and you will black out
But before buy a shirt or two

We'll be rich, really rich, yeah so rich

After two years we're forgotten
Business goes last today
For a solo comeback I am their man
The company plans always pay

They are rich, really rich, yeah so rich

Go for the money before it's gone
Take all the chances while you're stll young
Go for the money, don't wait too long
You've got the choice, my "Splendid Boys"

Early in the mourning hours

13. Disco Destroyer

I'm a Disco Destroyer
Can I borrow your axe
I don't care - yes, I can
We gonna smash all the fucking discos
And burn them to their fucking ground
From Frankfurt to Frisco I destroy all discos
I'm real fucking DISCO DESTROYER...
