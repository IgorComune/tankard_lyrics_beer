"The Beauty And The Beer" (2006)

1. Ice-olation

My Fate has been sealed
With a Bottle Cap
Where am I going?
I cannot wait!
Where is the Paty?
Hope I am not too late
Let's have a good time
And drink Tonight

[Chorus:]
Ice-olation
Where am i now?
It's getting colder
Ice Crystals are growing in me
And fucking with my Mind
Ice-olation
I'm dying now - it's almost over
You put me into Freezer
Is this the way to go?

Visit the Booze Store
You're not so sure, man
Hard Liquer of the other?
You opt for the Barley
And put me into Fridge
Hey! What's the matter?
It's really cold here
My Loins expand beyond reach
It's over, you Asshole
And now it's time to die!

[Chorus]

My Fate has been sealed
With a Bottle Cap
Where am I going?
I cannot wait!
Where is the Paty?
Hope I am not too late
Let's have a good time
And drink Tonight

[Chorus]

I've got the Shivers
And near the end now
I bid you Drunkards Farewell
I love you, think of me
I spread my Wings and fly
Don't ever forget
That Shit can happen
Don't leave your Beer in a Freezer
This loss you will regret
If you don't use your mind.


2. We Still Drink The Old Ways

Back in the old land of beer
In 1516 times
Univirtuous brewers ruined the business
Spoiling and polluting the beer with grubby things
Duke of Bavaira
Forced laws and guaranteed
Needs of the people for healthy protection
Oldest consumer rights today

[Chorus:]
We drink the old ways!
You're asking what, you're asking why
We're into "pure stuff"!
Preservatives : we don't comply!
Don't comply!
We still drink the old ways!
Don't comply!
We still drink the old ways!

Wise rules, pleasant tradition
Make beer fans satisfied
Services and handicraft
Pure beer means quality
It's a commitment, and it's essential
Purity of barley, water, hops and yeast
Nine hundred breweries are there in this country
They care for standards, masters of enzymes
Just girls and wimps drink import-beer.

[Chorus]

Your choice to pick a good mass
Stay clean and drink with class


3. Forsaken World

Welcome my friend
To "Agency Of Hazards"
Book your own hip disaster trip
To greenhouse planet earth
Hurricane-havoc live!
We''ll drop you in, watch millions die!

[Chorus:]
Forsaken world
It's catastrophe time
Forsaken world
Hail storms and volcano
Tidal waves at coastal lines
Forsaken world
Take some picture
We guarantee the judgement day is oming
Mankind is blocked and nature's shocked
Weather out of control
Ruins under burning skies
Plus many souvenirs to buy!

[Chorus]

Welcome my friend
To "Agency Of Hazards"
Book your own hip disaster trip
To greenhouse planet earth
Hurricane-havoc live!
We''ll drop you in, watch millions die!


4. Rockstars No. 1

Hey Dad, you always had your doubts
But this time I am gonna make you proud

[Chorus:]
This time, I swear
I'll be a famous star
Live up to my potential
Success is not afar
In future the leader
Here in this great country
Some say I even could be
The pope of Germany

Loud, fast and heavy!
My idols come to town
And I am on the guest list!
Loud, fast and heavy!
Olaf, Gerre, Frank and Andy, you will rule tonight
Later I'll meet you at back-stage
Loud, fast and heavy!
Party time! To be here is a blast
Hey, Tankard, nice meeting you at last

[Chorus]

Old, lame and stinky! I can't believe this shit
These guys are square and sober!
Old, lame and stinky!
All with families, kids and houses, jobs and normal lives
Don't wanna be like you clowns!
Old, lame and stinky!
Know what? Fame is a stupid farce
You can shine, even if you're no star

[Chorus 2:]
This time, I swear
I'll be a famous star
Live up to my potential
Success is not afar
Hot chicks and cars
Much money beer and fun
I know I'll never be like
The Rockstars No. 1

Hey Dad, you always had your doubts
But this time I am gonna make you proud

[Chorus 2]

Hey dad!


5. The Beauty And The Beer

I take my chances!
I'm well educated
I earn good wages
Mothers-in-law craves for me
I take my chances
My teeth are shiny
My face is handsome
There is no doubt about it
I take my chances!
Last night: a new sensation
This beauty hit my eyes
Dressed in the blackest shadow
A devil in disguise
What can I do to draw your eyes attention?
What can I do not to make you realize?

The beauty and the beast
A mystery unrevealed
The beauty and the beast
Both hide inside of me
The beauty and the beast
Control my life

I got to get you!
You are a bombshell
A cute maneater
A creature of the nighttime
I got to get you
Fuck the conventions
Fuck for devotees
Crushed underneath your high-heels
I got to get you!
Longing, I'm craving for you
But you don't notice me
My shiny life means nothing
To you, you just won't see

What can I do to draw your eyes attention?
What can I do not to make you realize?

The beauty and the beast
A mystery unrevealed
The beauty and the beast
Both hide inside of me
The beauty and the beast
Control my life
The beauty and the beast
A mystery unrevealed
The beauty and the beast
Both hide inside of me
The beauty and the beast
Control my life

I feel a changing!
This magic potion
From fifteen sixteen
Runs through my boiling veins now
I feel a changing!
It's so much bolder
And yet I hold her
My blood is running colder
I feel a changing!
Drinking is our business
We queue the welfare line
We spend our days consuming
Magical beer and wine

What can I do to draw your eyes attention?
What can I do not to make you realize?

The beauty and the beast
A mystery unrevealed
The beauty and the beast
Both hide inside of me
The beauty and the beast
Control my life
The beauty and the beast
A mystery unrevealed
The beauty and the beast
Both hide inside of me
The beauty and the beast
Control my life


6. Blue Rage - Black Redemption

Once there lives in times of crime
A young man full of ignorance
Formed the crips gang, spreading madness
Addiction, drugs, guns, violence
Like sleepwalking
On brutal ways
In southern central
L.A., CA

Prison shaped the mind of tookie
Death row, hell behind the bars
Got 25 to life
Prison shaped the mind of tookie
No governor-clemency "Blue Rage, Black Redemption" thoughts

Wrote to your peace protocols
That circumstance is no excuse
Warnings of a vicious lifestyle
Helping streets gangs build a truce
A nominee
For Nobel prize
Injection lethal
And so, piece died

Prison shaped the mind of tookie
Death row, hell behind the bars
Got 25 to life
Prison shaped the mind of tookie
No governor-clemency "Blue Rage, Black Redemption" thoughts

Like sleepwalking
On brutal ways
In southern central
L.A., CA

Prison shaped the mind of tookie
Death row, hell behind the bars
Got 25 to life
Prison shaped the mind of tookie
No governor-clemency "Blue Rage, Black Redemption" thoughts

Prison shaped the mind of tookie
Death row, hell behind the bars
Got 25 to life
Prison shaped the mind of tookie
No governor-clemency "Blue Rage, Black Redemption" thoughts


7. Frankfurt: We Need More Beers

One fine evening on earth
We stood on stage and played
When suddenly bright lightning
Disturbed our glorious show
Oh no! not again the alien!
Oh please, leave us alone!
"No more space beer" he cried
And begged us for our help
He told us on his planet
They're all about to die

Frankfurt: we need much more beer desperately
Answer quickly the brew's his destiny
Frankfurt: we need much more beer desperately
Answer quickly no beer for light years

Talked to binding straight off
They promised to supply
Six million sixty six packs
Stored in the green man's ship
Lift off! Leaving solar system
And we were all aboard
Galaxy "Dog" we stopped
The plasma drive broke down
Bad luck, caught by space pirates
They snatched our alcohol

Frankfurt: we need much more beer desperately
Answer quickly the brew's his destiny
Frankfurt: we need much more beer desperately
Answer quickly no beer for light years

Two days later...Bingo!
We tracked these scumbags down
Hot laser beams, explosions
Destroyed the Milky Way
Stop! Halt! Give up and surrender
Return the liquid gold!
All is well that ends well
Planet Bermuda waits
Big Alien-Super-Party
All drank up in one day

Frankfurt: we need much more beer desperately
Answer quickly the brew's his destiny
Frankfurt: we need much more beer desperately
Answer quickly no beer for light years


8. Metaltometal

Eye for an eye! You'll never defy
The power of metal will always survive!
The squealing of soulfags I deeply despise
Tooth for a tooth! I win, you will loose!
I still raise my fist, gonna shout it out loud
I will shout it out loud
Thundering chords is what life's all about!
Long-haired, cold-eyed, a leather-clad fist
Black-cloaked, strong-armed, a riveted wrist
Long-haired, cold-eyed, a leather-clad fist
An iron-clad wrost, an iron-clad wrist!

Metal to metal and guts to guts!
No country, no reggae, it's driving me nuts
Metal to metal, guts to guts!
Metal to metal and guts to guts!
No techno, no hip-hop, it's driving me nuts
Metal to metal, guts to guts!

Blood for some blood, you may kiss my butt
To get in my way gets your face in the mud
I'll tread your face in the mud
High time to rough up this ramshackle hut
Dust to some dust, gotta roll on or bust
A quick-spinning wheel never knows any rust!
I'll never know any rust
In each town the girls wait and for them I lust
Long-haired, cold-eyed, a leather-clad fist
Black-cloaked, strong-armed, a riveted wrist
Long-haired, cold-eyed, a leather-clad fist
An iron-clad wrost, an iron-clad wrist!

Metal to metal and guts to guts!
No country, no reggae, it's driving me nuts
Metal to metal, guts to guts!
Metal to metal and guts to guts!
No techno, no hip-hop, it's driving me nuts
Metal to metal, guts to guts!

Metal to metal and guts to guts!
No country, no reggae, it's driving me nuts
Metal to metal, guts to guts!
Metal to metal and guts to guts!
No techno, no hip-hop, it's driving me nuts
Metal to metal, guts to guts!


9. Dirty Digger

One billionaire
Will rule the word
A press-tycoon controls
What's to be seen and heard
Conservative
Right-wing bully
Letting his media
Hunt down democracy
Creative mind in mankind money
Hollywood man
Tax havens, L.A.Dodgers
Internet newbie, baseball fan
British papers, TV-stations
Eurosceptic to the bone
Samantha Fox for breakfast
Serves business all alone

Dirty digger – come on bite!
Cause you care for no one
Spreading News Corp. cancer like
Dirty digger – come on bite!
Cause you care for no one
Spreading News Corp. cancer like

You held the hand of Maggie Thatcher
Deals in the dark
You plead for war on Bush's invasion
For cheaper oil down in Iraq
Kissing Chinese leaders asses
To get rights for satellites
Only James Bond could stop you
Tomorrow never dies

Dirty digger – come on bite!
Cause you care for no one
Spreading News Corp. cancer like
Dirty digger – come on bite!
Cause you care for no one
Spreading News Corp. cancer like

Creative mind in mankind money
Hollywood man
Tax havens, L.A.Dodgers
Internet newbie, baseball fan
British papers, TV-stations
Eurosceptic to the bone
Samantha Fox for breakfast
Serves business all alone

Dirty digger – come on bite!
Cause you care for no one
Spreading News Corp. cancer like
Dirty digger – come on bite!
Cause you care for no one
Spreading News Corp. cancer like

One billionaire
Will rule the word
A press-tycoon controls
What's to be seen and heard


10. Shaken Not Stirred

My job's exhausting, that's why I am waiting
For the end of the week to come
Then me and all my buddies
Go to the "Diner's Rum"
Booze-drinking community just pay one time a monthly fee
Where heavy drinkers will unite
Cider, Lager, Whiskey, Wine
Have cocktails, Vodka, Gin and lime
On ice!

(Drink! It's all you can drink I it's all you...)
Hey, Mr.Bartender
Let's draft our brains away
My head feels well shaken
Not stirred, but that's OK

Drinking is both, an art and a science
Practice hard with Himbeerschnaps
Win "Golden Bottle" contests
Or "Warm ale challenge" cups
Banquets alcoholic style
Glassbuffets make your lives smile
Wish I could be here all week
My boss told me yesterday, if I don't quit, he fires me
This freak!

(Drink! It's all you can drink I it's all you...)
Hey, Mr.Bartender
