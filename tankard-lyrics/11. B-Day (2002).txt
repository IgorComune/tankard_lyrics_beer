"B-Day" (2002)

1. Notorious Scum

Woke up this mourning in a dirty room
All naked, pissed, in a pool of puke
We did it again!
On the road to the next location
Going crazy on a tour de force
A whiskey breakfast, loads of drugs
There's plenty of chicks!
Getting stoned in a Blow Job's heaven

Just watch our show
Hell on earth has come to town
Ears deaf, you will know
We turned your graveyard upside down

Hey, dude, we are freaks of life
We are notorious scum, scum we are!
Fuck you! We'll fuck your wife
We are notorious scum, scum we are!

Born in the gutter of our fucking town
Dealin' crack to survive the day
We're killers of man!
Dominant, never showed some mercy
Today we give a shit about our past
Life is too short, so live it fast
Get out of the way!
Money rules, we are free of sin

Just watch our show
Hell on earth has come to town
Ears deaf, you will know
We turned your graveyard upside down

Hey, dude, we are freaks of life
We are notorious scum, scum we are!
Fuck you! We'll fuck your wife
We are notorious scum, scum we are!

2. Rectifier

You've got a big mouth! Blessed with no brain!
You cannot keep up, it's all in vain
No use discussing 'cause intelligence you lack
You can't keep up, no hope, you stabbed me in the back

All talk, no action! You bore me so!
You're full of bullshit why don't you go?
You've stated reasons why your past is full of holes
But you chose me, pathetic, what's your fucking goal

Rectifier, Rectifier
I know your name, you no-good liar!
Rectifier, Rectifier
I'll chase your ass till you expire!
Rectifier, Rectifier
My gun is loaded - time to fire!

3. Need Money For Beer

I was born in beer, my object of lust
But got no money, still drink I must
I search my pockets, and what do I find
Useless cleenex to wipe my behind

I need a Goddamn brew
That's why I've come to you

You bastard, I hate you
I kill you, you can lick my butt
So pious and gracious
Intention isn't very clear
You bastard, still hate you
Need money for a fucking beer

You've got the cash, so give it to me
Dig you in your Wallet and set me free
Expect no thanks, you can kiss my ass
I'll ball your girlfriend and cum with class

I need a Goddamn brew
That's why I've come to you

You bastard, I hate you
I kill you, you can lick my butt
So pious and gracious
Intention isn't very clear
You bastard, still hate you
Need money for a fucking beer

You bastard, I hate you
I kill you, you can lick my butt
You bastard, still hate you
Need money for a fucking beer

I was born in beer, my object of lust
But got no money, still drink I must
I search my pockets, and what do I find
Useless cleenex to wipe my behind

You bastard, I hate you
I kill you, you can lick my butt
So pious and gracious
Intention isn't very clear
You bastard, still hate you
Need money for a fucking beer


4. Ugly, Fat And Still Alive

Early in the eighties
The brealdancers very strong
But we destroyed their discos
The day and all night long

Our loudness was incredible
Our metal alcoholical

Zombies attacked us from behind
But we survived the Berlin nights

Ugly, fat and alive
Twenty years of thrash 'til death
Ugly, fat and alive
Bangin' 'til our final breath
Ugly, fat and alive
Always held the bottles high
Ugly, fat and alive

And then we joined the beer-wars
Invasion chemical
We puked into the tour bus
The morning after smell

Our loudness was incredible
Our metal alcoholical

There knocked an alien at my door
"Meaning of life?" it asked me for

Ugly, fat and alive
Twenty years of thrash 'til death
Ugly, fat and alive
Bangin' 'til our final breath
Ugly, fat and alive
Always held the bottles high
Ugly, fat and alive

We won't be stone cold sober
Like our two-faced manager
We do the tankard club tour
No groupies there at all

Our loudness was incredible
Our metal alcoholical

We still destroy all discos
The kings of beer are back, let's go

Ugly, fat and alive
Twenty years of thrash 'til death
Ugly, fat and alive
Bangin' 'til our final breath
Ugly, fat and alive
Always held the bottles high
Ugly, fat and alive


5. Underground (Atmosphere Hostile)

Long time ago
We found this place
Thousands of years
We crossed the interstellar space
World after world
Sowing the seeds
Another planet
For a new genetic breed

This atmosphere is hostile
That's why we have to meet
Underground
You're like a death-bringing storm
Come, see your ancestors
Underground

We gave them mind
Taught our love
And then retired deep down
To the planet's core
Over the time
Their cultures grew
But they developed violence,
And that was new

This atmosphere is hostile
That's why we have to meet
Underground
You're like a death-bringing storm
Come, see your ancestors
Underground

Religion is the root of sin
Killing the weak
They let the genocide begin
They know no bounds
They learned to lie
The human race has failed
And now they're gonna die

This atmosphere is hostile
That's why we have to meet
Underground
You're like a death-bringing storm
Come, see your ancestors
Underground

You had the earth for a while
Destroyed it all, mile for mile
And so you're gonna die
Our wrath will cover the sun
Because we have to move on
Your corpses will remain
Underground


6. Voodoo Box

I'm a low life, trash, riff-raff
Drinkin' booze, pub-crawling man
Psychotics on narcotics I need 10 bottles a day

Lame and useless to the bone, broken dreams, leave me alone

But the last day, back alley
A loony guy gave me the creeps
His hands and feet were crippled
He said: "This is for you"

Voodoo box, black magic, mumbo-jumbo, washing well
Voodoo box, kingmaker, gift of gods, or sent from hell?
Voodoo box, black magic, mumbo-jumbo, washing well
Voodoo box, my master, gonna pay that bloody bill

It's so easy, fascinating
How my wealth and power grow
Addictive and destructive, Champagne and fancy cars

For every wish it lets me pay, sacrificed my ears today

After years of self-mutilation
Nearly nothing left on me
I know, I must continue
Think I'll give my other eye

Voodoo box, black magic, mumbo-jumbo, washing well
Voodoo box, kingmaker, gift of gods, or sent from hell?
Voodoo box, black magic, mumbo-jumbo, washing well
Voodoo box, my master, gonna pay that bloody bill

Voodoo box, black magic, mumbo-jumbo, washing well
Voodoo box, kingmaker, gift of gods, or sent from hell?

I'm a low life, trash, riff-raff
Drinkin' booze, pub-crawling man
Psychotics on narcotics I need 10 bottles a day

Lame and useless to the bone, broken dreams, leave me alone

Voodoo box, black magic, mumbo-jumbo, washing well
Voodoo box, kingmaker, gift of gods, or sent from hell?
Voodoo box, black magic, mumbo-jumbo, washing well
Voodoo box, my master, gonna pay that bloody bill


7. Sunscars

Darkness, I feel the hunger in a world of the silver moonlight
Living beyond the grave from the cold of the earth I will rise

Unseen, and cloaked in shadows when I crawl over cryptic ceilings
Modern to gothic times eating souls of the mortal begins

Sunscars all over my body
On my pale skin marks of light
Filthy fingernails, encrusted
Sunscars - back to the night
Sunscars all over my body
On my pale skin marks of death
Bloodbath on the edge of sunrise
Sunscars - I have to rest

Virgins, I love to kill them I despise religious vermin
I'm not the will of god, centuries on my blackened teeth grin

Black clouds, the nightwinds howling as your body collapses lifeless
Ripped out the heart and throat, frosty day, far away, I'm ageless

Sunscars all over my body
On my pale skin marks of light
Filthy fingernails, encrusted
Sunscars - back to the night
Sunscars all over my body
On my pale skin marks of death
Bloodbath on the edge of sunrise
Sunscars - I have to rest

Darkness, I feel the hunger in a world of the silver moonlight
Living beyond the grave from the cold of the earth I will rise

Unseen, and cloaked in shadows when I crawl over cryptic ceilings
Modern to gothic times eating souls of the mortal begins

Sunscars all over my body
On my pale skin marks of light
Filthy fingernails, encrusted
Sunscars - back to the night
Sunscars all over my body
On my pale skin marks of death
Bloodbath on the edge of sunrise
Sunscars - I have to rest


8. Zero Dude

Sticky hands, smelly feet
Badly breath, fart of death
Please don't mind my running nose
I've got everything you need

I gotta good feet, this is a good deal
Gimme your Dollars, make it real
Tomorrow's too late, for every good trade
Don't think about it, don't hesitate

Come on in, look around

See my sex-toys? Best in town!

A piece of cake, a piece of cake
Can get ya porn-shit, or pink shampoo

The people call me "Zero Dude"
My hair is fake, my hair is fake
No problem, man, I've got attitude
I am the man with the million lighters
The people call me "Zero Dude"

Irish stew, british glue
I sell safes and satellites

I gotta good feet, this is a good deal
Gimme your Dollars, make it real
Tomorrow's too late, for every good trade
Don't think about it, don't hesitate

Tell your friend 'bout my shop
Come again, buy a lot
Doesn't matter, if you're broke

10. Rundown Quarter

There are thugs and murders here
They want kill and raping you
Houses are not very good
Only badly ruins

Badly houses! Destroyed houses!
Cruely gangs! Brutal people!

Rundown quarter! Rundown district!
Rundown quarter! Rundown district!

Corpses lying dead in streets
People stumble over them
Suicides are every day
They are burning up themselves

Badly houses! Destroyed houses!
Cruely gangs! Brutal people!

Rundown quarter! Rundown district!
Rundown quarter! Rundown district!

Police couldn't help the people
Murderers are so very happy
Don't go in the rundown section
Ooh it's so dangerous

Badly houses! Destroyed houses!
Cruely gangs! Brutal people!

Rundown quarter! Rundown district!
Rundown quarter! Rundown district!


11. Alcoholic Nightmares

I'll crash your fucking party
And I don't know for what
I ate your awesome chilli
Now you deal with my smelly butt

We'll spend the whole night talking
Dictate what you will hear
But then I start to quiver
In the name of a fucking beer

Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
Consciousness dying
Unrelentless turbo rage

This is your nightmare
And I'll do my best
This is your nightmare
I'm a fucking pest
This is your nightmare
Unexpected guest
I am your nightmare
Am your nightmare, am your nightmare

You thought you all would have fun
But then I came along
You thought I was your buddy
Now I've proved everybody wrong

Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
Consciousness dying
Unrelentless turbo rage

This is your nightmare
And I'll do my best
This is your nightmare
I'm a fucking pest
This is your nightmare
Unexpected guest
I am your nightmare
Am your nightmare, am your nightmare

I'll crash your fucking party
And I don't know for what
I ate your awesome chilli
Now you deal with my smelly butt

Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
Consciousness dying
Unrelentless turbo rage

This is your nightmare
And I'll do my best
This is your nightmare
I'm a fucking pest
This is your nightmare
Unexpected guest
I am your nightmare
Am your nightmare, am your nightmare
