"Zombie Attack" (1986)

1. Zombie Attack

I'm just hanging around tonight, just watching films
I am on the Zombie Trip and brutal things I like

Zombie attack

The film I saw is over now and I leave my home
Brutal Zombies are shouting so hard, is it real or not?

Zombie attack

I wake up, this was a dream, I drink my beer
But then I see a Zombie killin', I know I must die


2. Poison

She's got a look that knocking you down
Her husband is so angry kicks her in the teeth

He want to kill, he wants to poison
Poison - he's a maniac
Poison poison

Fuckin' little worms are creeping in her face
The man gets crazy and he must kick her down

Smash the axe into her fuckin' ugly face
The blood is running out of her eyes


3. Acid Death

An insane murderer is comin' to you
You are cryin' horrible to God
But Satan laughs and doesn't help
You are gonna die in Hell tonight
Fight for the nation underground
Dyin' and killin' so hard tonight
We break up the wall of sound
The end is near we will fight
He is so cruel and likes the acid
Satan gave him the power to kill
Nobody thinks that he is the man
Who is killing without end
Acid death


4. (Empty) Tankard

Drinking and fucking through the whole night long
Partying with friends 'til fucking dawn
Let's go thrashin' and stagedivin'
Feel the power and sound again

We want to drink some fucking beer,
we want to drink some whiskey

Frankfurt's thrashers will rule tonight
They're well known for their bloody fight
Wodka and Cognac are our leaders
We've the best, we fuck the fuckin' rest

Empty Tankard

We have come to slamdance tonight
Bangin' and bleedin' till the fuckin' end
Playing fast and running free
Stand up maniacs, you have to fight

We want to drink some fucking beer,
we want to drink some whiskey

Liver is broken down so bloody hard
I keep on drinking until I drop
Bang your head against the fuckin' wall
Show the damned whimps who we are

Empty Tankard


5. Chains (In Your Face)

Danger! Danger! They kill without fear
Without a warning you'll die tonight
Hunting and killing and raping again,
their only aim to take your life
Die, die! Brutal gangs of death
Innocent victims they like to kill
Fear, fear! We know their cruelty
Hope never to meet them

Death - is real tonight
Chains - you have no chance
Death - is real tonight
Blood - is what they need
Chains, chains (In your face)

Fight, fight! Answer their aggressions
Take the weapons and defend yourself
Hunting and killing and raping again,
their only aim to take your life
Kill, kill! The time has come
Hope, hope! We dance on their graves
Now they've payed for their brutal murders


6. Alcohol

Drinkin' beer somewhere with me
Playin' loud and poppers flee
I want booze and beer and wine
To be drunk it's to fine

Come and drink alcohol!
Come and drink beer with me!
Come and drink alcohol!
Come and drink wine with me!

Pukin' all day all night ling,
come let's dance to another song
Playin' destructive bangin' metal
Come, let's fight this battle
Come, and drink alcohol! Come and dr...


7. Thrash Till Death

Bang your head against the stage like you never did before
We will burn this town tonight, to deadly metal we want bang
Headbanging is the sense of life, we play it hard and loud
Blood is running fast tonight because future there's no more

Bang bang it must never end
this way is our only chance
Die in blood and pain tonight
never ends the metal fight
Thrash till death

We were born to sacrifice your souls to bloody metal
Death is behind us all, lose the fear of killin' hard
Metal is the only aim you have to live your life for
Thrash until you are knocked down, metal is your last resort


8. Maniac Forces

Bombs of destruction threaten our world
They say: We need'em for defending
Millions of citizen must hunger for their insanity
Wiping out our whole planet

Maniac forces

Russians and Americans accuse each other
Of having more bombs than the other one
We live in an uncertain world
Be afraid of the beginning of World War 3
