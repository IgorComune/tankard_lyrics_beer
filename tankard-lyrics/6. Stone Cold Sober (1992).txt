"Stone Cold Sober" (1992)

1. Jurisdiction

Our clean-cut leaders
In dirty money they deal
Transactions undercover
They bribe, divert and steal

Industry bosses
And the political class
Scratching each others back and
Kissing each other's ass for cash

Where do you see a just society

Fuck the law! Fuck the law!
They can do it in your face
Fuck the law! Fuck the law!
When the're in a higher place

Who said we're equal?
Laws only goverb the slobs
No one goes after those who
Do the white collar jobs

For tax evasion
A fine you maybe will pay
But as a demonstrator
They will look you away for sure

Equality is just a fantasy

Fuck the law! Fuck the law!
They can do it in your face
Fuck the law! Fuck the law!
When the're in a higher place

Crime and punishment?
The law is sacred
It makes most people behave
But if you have the power
You make the law your slave

There is no justice
That's what the proverb says
The small ones always get caught
The big ones always get away

Where do you see a just society?

Fuck the law! Fuck the law!
They can do it in your face
Fuck the law! Fuck the law!
When the're in a higher place

Fuck the law! Fuck the law!
They can do it in your face
Fuck the law! Fuck the law!
When the're in a higher place
Fuck the law! Fuck the law!
They can do it in your face
Fuck the law! Fuck the law!
When the're in a higher place


2. Broken Image

Images flooding all of your channels and
Senses down inflated facts
All is now is all
Meshes
Where is the catch in the net of a
World of world
Appropriate reality meaningful fluidity

Disconnected symbol signify no more
In decontextualizing fuckers
Of the TV's amputated signs is it

Mediation the screen is hiding a meaning
Fragmentation broken mirror
Performation the mind assembles the pieces
Information reconstruction?

Memory passing into oblivion
History postmodernized into the present
Distance
Collapse into a design of coincidence
No tomorrow in today and tomorrow
No today

Arbitrary symbols signify no more
In uncontextualizing fluidal
Collages washing it away
Give me

Mediation the text is hiding a meaning
Fragmentation broken mirror
Performation the mind assembles the pieces
Information reconstruction?

Where am I, I need to clutch a
Solid word that simply means
Nothing real is here around me
Language is reduced to schemes

S.O.S. communication
Breaking down without a code
Free but lost without a limit
Endless nothing in the way

Anarchy but language is violent
Is there no escaping it without destruction
Meaning the final quest leading into obscurity
Curses on a conscious mind reiteration endlessy

Unremotting spirales
Twisting common sense
Is there no communicatio
Silence no solution
Neither is the word
Is there

Mediation is mind is hiding a meaning
Fragmentation broken mirror
Reformation the mind assembles the pices
Information reconstruction?


3. Mindwild

Violent chambers, neon glaring off the white tile walls
Ethical sterility aims to quelch the smell of fear
We know of the agony you tand to here
We know pain just as you
Remember this forever

Master of life, your soul is so clinical
To heal, you maim, your reasons to cinical
Mindwild - you shall feel the pain you give
Mindwild - you will die if we can't live
Now that we're mindwild, you're one of use

Something binds you, spikes of metak piercing through your thoughts
Mice and man are much the same, toxing pumper through your veins
Remember to take your pulse and chart the pain
You and me, eye to eye
I whisper through your nightmare

Master of life, a demi-god they call your like
Angel of death, now bleed red your robe of white
Mindwild - you shall feel the pain you give
Mindwild - you will die if we can't live
Now that we're mindwild, you're one of use

Silent chambers, empty cages, shattered means of pain
Human, creatures, leave behind ruins of an evil dream
The final experiment has ceased the scream
You and we are of one
Remember this forever

Master of life, your kind is not masterly
Lay down the crown, you reign is mere anarchy
Mindwild - you shall feel the pain you give
Mindwild - you will die if we can't live
Now that we're mindwild, you're one of use


4. Ugly Beauty

Woman of my dreams, so blond and beautiful
I just got to have that lady, so sweet and dressed to kill
We went out on a date
I took here to my place
She whispered in my ear
She's do anything for me
When she got undressed I found to my surprise
Padded bra and cotton stuffung, a whig and Jelly thighs
She was not what she was cracked up to be

What you see is awful beauty
Don't you be a sucker for some caudy illusion
What you get is pretty ugly
Look behind the picture for a different conclusion

Going on a trip, I've got to get away
Makes me feel so free and easy when I lay myself I line
No troubles anymore
I float above the floor
But no I'm crashing down
The world is spinning round
Need another kick, I got the Junkie blues
Down and out I feel like dying, my mind is so confused
Lies and self-delusion, heaven is hell

What you see is awful beauty
Don't you be a sucker for some caudy illusion
What you get is pretty ugly
Look behind the picture for a different conclusion

Everybody's dream, money and luxury
All my wishes and desires, I buy'em just like that
Ten cars and twenty whores
Wild parties, been galore
A golden tiolet seat
But still I feel like shit
Now I realize you can't buy hapiness
Everybody loves my money, but my life is a mess
Everything that glistens need not be gold

What you see is awful beauty
Don't you be a sucker for some caudy illusion
What you get is pretty ugly
Look behind the picture for a different conclusion


5. Centerfold

[Written by Seth Justman, Originally performed by J. Geils Band]

Does she walk? Does she talk?
Does she come complete?
My homeroom homeroom angel
Always pulled me from my seat

She was pure like snowflakes
No one could ever stain
The memory of my angel
Could never cause me pain

Years go by I'm lookin' through a girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel on the pages in-between

[CHORUS]
My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold
[Repeat]

Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinkin' about her dress
I was shy I turned away
Before she caught my eye

I was shakin' in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by

Those soft and fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
Too see her in that negligee
Is really just too much

[Chorus]

It's okay I understand
This ain't no never-never land
I hope that when this issue's gone
I'll see you when your clothes are on

Take you car, Yes we will
We'll take your car and drive it
We'll take it to a motel room
And take 'em off in private

A part of me has just been ripped
The pages from my mind are stripped
Oh no, I can't deny it
Oh yea, I guess I gotta buy it!

[CHORUS]


6. Behind The Back

Rumors growing like a cancer
From the rotting fester of envy
Sleazy liars, character assassins
In the shadows lay their seed
These two-faced snakes
Crawling before you
Serpents, vermin, waitinfg to jump you
Weaving webs of poisonous chatter
Sweet-talk facing you in daylight

Behind the back - what you cannot see
(B.T.B.) - They pull the knife on you, the hypocrites fight cowardly
Behind the back - (To) get the best of you
(B.T.B.) - whenyou've got friends lake that you don't need any enemies

Creedy, groping for attention
Always hidibg their real intentions
Never honest, ever intriguing
Sing a poisoned song of praise they never say
What they are thinking
Phonu brothers speaking with two tongues
Join our posse, dig'us the next day
False friends, we can do without you
We have others we can trust

Beat it if you want to kiss ass
If you want to give us the back star
We don't need you spreading dirty stories
We just want to bang in peace
You'd better not
Play us for suckers
Say it, shout it, tell me to my face
I would like to get it from you straight
You got anything to say, man?
Do it like you're not a rat

Behind the back - what you cannot see
(B.T.B.) - They pull the knife on you, the hypocrites fight cowardly
Behind the back - (To) get the best of you
(B.T.B.) - whenyou've got friends lake that you don't need any enemies

Get off our back, Mac


7. Stone Cold Sober

Hey, liste, we're so sick of it
Fire water is the devil's drink
Don't want it, no more chugaloo
Empty Tankard? Fill it up with milk!

Minerals! Vegetables! Health food and some peppermint tea
No more of that liquod death
No more beer! No more booze! We'll play healthy metal instead

No whisky, you can have our beer
We'll be living in sobpiety
Immortal! Drinking is a sin
Prohibition is a good idea

Alcoholic days are gone - gonna fight those evil ways
Stone cold sober - gonna stick to the perrier
Alcohol is no more fun - gonna drink our tonic straight
Stone cold sober - and we're all gonna lose some weight

Don't do it! Through your beer away!
There'a a better way to have some fun
At parties, if you wanna booze
Get a six-pack of tomato juice

Minerals! Vegetables! Health food and some peppermint tea
No more of that liquod death
No more beer! No more booze! We'll play healthy metal instead

Believe it, we are clean and dry
We could play a gig at double a
Headbangers on a water binge
If you're heavy don't you drink and dive

Alcoholic days are gone - gonna fight those evil ways
Stone cold sober - gonna stick to the perrier
Alcohol is no more fun - gonna drink our tonic straight
Stone cold sober - and we're all gonna lose some weight

Merchendizing heavy metal link
Thrash soda in the water bar
Multivitamins - we got our fill

No more beer! No more booze! We'll play healthy metal instead

Alcoholic days are gone - gonna fight those evil ways
Stone cold sober - gonna stick to the perrier

Stone cold sober - and we're all gonna lose some weight


8. Blood, Guts And Rock'n'Roll

One, two, three pints of blood
On my cornflakes make me big and strong
Then I get my chainsaw, then I get my
I am gonna slaughter, 'cos I need it to relax

I'm just kidding cornflake killers my new hit
We're the band that signs of death, violence, blood and all that shit
Acid, chains, eating brains
Maniacs and killers
Deadly music is our trade
Murder, bloodshed, body parts, gory mess
Dripping from our stereo, slashing is the way to go

Blood metal - it's my life
Killing, hurt and pain
Blood metal - there's nothing better
Blood and guts and rock'n'roll
Give me psychotic murder, must be fun to be insane

Songs about cannibals
Roasting victims, human barbecue
Fingers for the cheesedip, grilling legs and thight
Won't you come and join us? We will cut you down to size

Mutilation is the business of our show
Sacrifice of human life, set it in our video
Making cash with our trash
Everybody wants to
Live a sadist fantasy
Murder, bloodshed, body parts, gory mess
Dripping from our stereo, slashing is the way to go

Blood metal - it's my life
Killing, hurt and pain
Blood metal - there's nothing better
Blood and guts and rock'n'roll
Give me psychotic murder, must be fun to be insane

I'm so scared, cut myself
In the finger, blood is dripping now
Someone's got to help me, think I'm gonna die
I am touch and brutal, but this pain it makes me cry

Lethal lyrics, ugly words that bite and slit
We're the band that signs of death, violence, blood and all that shit
Acid, chains, eating brains
Maniacs and killers
Deadly music is our trade
Murder, bloodshed, body parts, gory mess
Dripping from our stereo, slashing is the way to go

Blood metal - it's my life
Killing, hurt and pain
Blood metal - there's nothing better
Blood and guts and rock'n'roll
Give me psychotic murder, must be fun to be insane

Blood metal - it's my life
Killing, hurt and pain
Blood metal - there's nothing better
Blood and guts and rock'n'roll
Give me psychotic murder, must be fun to be insane


9. Lost And Found (Tantrum Part 2)

Still all this party, raising hell to get my beer
I will go crazy, if I don't find it here
Someone snatched my only joy
If you touch it you will die
I'll never give up, I'll will kill to get it back
Which dirty bastards stole my beloved suds?

Curses by the sixpack cast on you!
Merciless I'll break you, thief of brew
Still I am getting ill
Need my regular fill
I will have to kill
For my rightful beer

They all look guilty, it's a damn conspiracy
I'll spare nobody fighting for liberty
Crash the party with a cry
Either they will die or I
Fists in my stomach, kicking me in my poor face
Bleeding and hurting they call me a disgrace

Curses by the sixpack cast on you!
Merciless you broke me, thieves of brew
Still I am getting ill
Need my regular fill
I will have to kill
For my rightful beer

Slumped in the corner, feeling like a total dope
My head is spinning, no friends, no booze, no hope
Nothing left but suicide
Bid this evil world good-bye
But there's my beercan, recognize it on the spot
Must have forgot it when I went to the pot

Time for celebration, laughs and cheers
Reunification with my beer
Now - no more getting ill
Got my regular fill
I won't have to kill
For my rightful beer


10. Sleeping With The Past

Mr. Amorphous fron Germany
Goes with the fashion, as fashion goes
First a brown shirt, then a red shirt
Now his shirt is white as snow

Look to the future
(Nothing in the past, nothing in the past)
Wiping out what happened here yesterday
(Nothing in the past, nothing in the past)

Here is the deal
Part with the past, no memory
We won't ask you, we will clear you
If you play our game now
This is the deal
Show must go on, at any price

Brush of the victims of forty years
Too bad, so sorry, now let's get on
Who was spying, who was dying
Who is lying, who's to blame?

Look to the future
(Nothing in the past, nothing in the past)
don't dig up the stories long dead and gone
(Nothing in the past, nothing in the past)

Look to the future
(Nothing in the past, nothing in the past)
Wiping out what happened here yesterday
(Nothing in the past, nothing in the past)

Bygones are bygones is fast and clean
Whitewash the surface, that will be fine
Firtyfive was not a lesson
To the class of eightynine

Look to the future
(Nothing in the past, nothing in the past)
everything is starting all over there
(Nothing in the past, nothing in the past)

Look to the future
(Nothing in the past, nothing in the past)
Wiping out what happened here yesterday
(Nothing in the past, nothing in the past)

Show goes on!


11. Freibier

Es ist Freitag Abend, ich zieh' schon wieder los
Durch Frankfurts geile Kneipen, mein Durst ist riesengross
Meine Freunde sind auch schon wieder da
Wir nehmen einen zur Brust und finden's wunderbar
Langsam wird es viere, wir können jetzt kaum noch stehn
Die Kneipe schleisst jetzt sowieso, ich glaub' wir müssen gehn
Scheisse! Sind wir voll, ich schaff's nicht mehr nach Haus
Ich such mir jetzt 'ne Parkbank und ruh' mich lieber aus

Freibier für alle - sonst gibt's Krawalle
Freibier für alle - Friebier! Freibier
Freibier für alle - sonst gibt's Krawalle
Freibier für alle - Friebier! Freibier

Ich wache auf, es ist kalt, mein Schädel brennt wie Feuer
Mann, war das 'ne Nacht, die war mal wieder teuer
Scheisse! Ihr Schweine habt mein geld geklaut
Meine Frau und's Auto sowieso - ich bin 'ne arme Haut
Oh, Mann, ich hab 'schon wieder Durst doch kann mir nichts mehr holen
Ich treffe ein paar Freunde, sie würden auch bestohlen
Jetzt langt's uns! Schluss mit der langen Rede
Wir sturmen in die nächste Bar und schrei'n aus voller Kehle

Freibier für alle - sonst gibt's Krawalle
Freibier für alle - Friebier! Freibier
Freibier für alle - sonst gibt's Krawalle
Freibier für alle - Friebier! Freibier
