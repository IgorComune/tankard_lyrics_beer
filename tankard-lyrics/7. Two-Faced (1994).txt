"Two-Faced" (1994)

1. Death Penalty

Democratic nations continue executing murderers
Innocents youths and victims of racist justice.
The death penalty doesn't deter
Doesn't satisfy, doesn't add up - all is does is kill

I feel the noose get tight
Feel the injection needle
The gas is choking me
O god, my flesh is burning

I'm alone in a cell, doctor checked, I'm alive and well
Got a lunch a la carte, 'cos tonight I'm going to hell

Four long years they've been killing me
Every day hope and desperation
Will it be today? Did I get a stay?
I'm guilty...does it help to pray...no, no, I'm innocent

Death penalty
On death row, I'm death but still alive
Death penalty
What is it like, when every day's your last?
Manis, crazy, wired, hopeless, crying, tired
Prison personel always wear a smile

Priest tells me "Son, this is a best way"
If God's love then why crucify?
Blinded by the flesh of the media
A final portrait of the beast before the slaughter's one

Death penalty
On death row, I'm death but still alive
Death penalty
What is it like, when every day's your last?
Manis, crazy, wired, hopeless, crying, tired
Prison personel always wear a smile

Shaven clean, electrodes sucked tight
Want to scream, but I'm paralyzed
Electricity tearing through my veins
The path is ripping me apart, but I'm not dead just yet

Death penalty
On death row, I'm death but still alive
Death penalty
What is it like, when every day's your last?
Manis, crazy, wired, hopeless, crying, tired
Prison personel always wear a smile

Death penalty
On death row, I'm death but still alive
You don't now what is like, when every day's death penalty


2. R.T.V.

Nine o'clock on channel six
Get the beer and get the chips
Death is live opon the screen
It's reality TV!

New disasters! Don't you miss
All the details - we'll be back right after this
Poisoned children just for you, perverts giving interviews
Rapists do it on the air, sponsored by cosmetic care

Television's your evil eye - cables sputing filthy crud
Television is a pig sty - wallowing in real life mud
Television's your evil eye - wanking off to sex and blood

On patrol with cameras
Gonna make some victims stars
TV vamps, for blood we thirst
Help that man, but shoot him first

Moving pictures full of pain
Voyeurism - wet your ass and fry your brain
Zoom in on the pile of death, close-up of the smashed - in head
Interview the relatives, pay them cash for wet - hot tears

Television's your evil eye - cables sputing filthy crud
Television is a pig sty - wallowing in real life mud
Television's your evil eye - wanking off to sex and blood

Should there be a day of peace
We've our something up to sleeves
Our "assistant" will commit
Any shit to land a hit

Want to be on live TV?
Send a postcard, we'll take care of it, you will see

Television's your evil eye - cables sputing filthy crud
Television is a pig sty - wallowing in real life mud
Television's your evil eye - wanking off to sex and blood


3. Betrayed

You tell me everything has be a lie
Words like a knife they cut and something dies

Years are destroyed in a day - I'm betrayed
Don't even know what to say - I'm betrayed
I'm full of anger and pain - I'm betrayed
You're turning love into hate - I'm betrayed

Why were you messing 'round with other guys?
You cold have told me you're not satisfied

All this time you were deceiving me
Now there's dirt on all my memories

So many words and feelings insincere
So disappointed I could almost cry

Years are destroyed in a day - I'm betrayed
Don't even know what to say - I'm betrayed
I'm full of anger and pain - I'm betrayed
You're turning love into hate - I'm betrayed

I just can't understand what happened here
I can't believe you lied so many tears

Why oh why did you go on like this
Fooling me with one more poisoned kiss

I'm dead and empty now. To hurt to fell
You've taken everything, now go away!!!

Years are destroyed in a day - I'm betrayed
Don't even know what to say - I'm betrayed
I'm full of anger and pain - I'm betrayed
You're turning love into hate - I'm betrayed


4. Nation Over Nation

Nation by nation
Like measles on the map
Sprouting in all directions
From Mother Russia's lap
The dream of independence
Seeking identify
As the old orders crumble
But you must learn to see

Greatness! Raise the flag
Show your kids now proud it flies
This, my son, is God's own country
For its honour you must die

We are the chosen ones
This blood and soil is sacred
We above the rest

Nation over nation: myth of supremacy
People over people: chauvinist bigotry
Nation over nation: calls for hate, envy and war
Chaos and damnation: nation over nation

Power is the key
That's behind the rhetoric
Patriotic anesthetic
Blinded crowds fall for the trick

Parades and uniforms
Masking internal crisis
Afterming foreign threats

Nation over nation: myth of supremacy
People over people: chauvinist bigotry
Nation over nation: calls for hate, envy and war
Chaos and damnation: nation over nation

Ethnic manipulation
The curse of racial pride
Abuse by powermongers
Committing genocide

"Nation" is a scheme
giving power to elites
ideology concealing
exploitation and deceit

We are the chosen ones
This blood and soil is sacred
We above the rest

Nation over nation: myth of supremacy
People over people: chauvinist bigotry
Nation over nation: calls for hate, envy and war
Chaos and damnation: nation over nation


5. Days Of The Gun

Inner city Frankfurt, money rules the day
But the criminal guys and the white powder rule the night
The innocent are crying, the helpless and the blind
Are overrun by the right - shallow - minded fools

So tell me now, now can you watch the news
As a man gets killed in front of your front door?

Call for the police, call for the lawyer
In the end the days of the gun will change your life

Slowly creeps the creature of violence and corruption
Turning the town into a white - washed mafia area
The rich are getting richer, the poor lose their homes
But as long as your cars are clean, just don't worry about it

So tell me how, how can you be amused
As a woman is raped in the dark in your backyard

Call for your wife, call for your mother
In the end the days of the gun will change your life

So tell me now, now can you watch the news
As a man gets killed in front of your front door?

Pray to heaven, pay for the church
In the end the days of the gun will change your life

Call for your wife, call for your mother
Call for the police, call for the lawyer...


6. Cities In Flames

You're death is what I need
Fighting for deliverance, fighting in the night
Try to be dead! Try to be wrong!

You're pain my evil creed
Fighting for the instruments, fighting metal Gods
Pray to be dead! Pray for the breed!

Oh my lord, see the light of the sun
Kill your mother, oh my lord, kill your son

Turn it all around
Tear it up I wanna die
Suck my blood to make me cry

Satan's frying my brain
Dying for the overkill, dying for my death
Fear what I say! Hear it today!

No way to suck up
Stick it in your face, do it for the pain
My Satan song! Is not so long!

Feel the death of your brain, oh my god
Going crazy in your mind, baby stop

Turn it all around
Tear it up I wanna die
Suck my blood to make me cry

You're death is what I need
Fighting for deliverance, fighting in the night
Try to be dead! Try to be wrong!

You're pain my evil creed
Fighting for the instruments, fighting metal Gods
Pray to be dead! Pray for the breed!

Oh my lord, see the light of the sun
Kill your mother, oh my lord, kill your son

Turn it all around
Tear it up I wanna die
Suck my blood to make me cry


7. Up From Zero

Every day I'm a slave to the grind
Think I'm loosing my mind
9 to 5 ain't mu kind of routine
Ain't nobody's machine
Boss says: think of the future
But what about today?
'Cos if I die tomorrow
There ain't no time to waste

I'm leaving
I'm doing my own thing
I'll do it...on my own

Wanna feel I'm alive, I'm a man
Gonna do all I can
Gonna try 'til I get what I need
Never give ups my creed
Make up your mind and do it
And feel you're wild at heart
Life is to short to worry
You've got to make a start

Up from zero - to where I wanna be
No one's hero - I do it just for me
Up from zero - it may be hard to do
No one's hero - but you can make it too

Outta work, outta cash, outta booze
But I won't sing no blues
Gonna play, gonna will, wanna bet?
Don't you think I'm done yet
When bad luck gets me down, hey
I'll just get up again
No room for desperation
'Cos I like happy ends

I'll rise up
Show you what I can take
I'll make it...check it out

Doesn't help to complain about your fate
Cos there ain't no escape
What you do is you put up a fight
Get a grip, set things right
When she starts getting nasty
Look fortune in the eye
She will smile down upon you
If you just really try

Up from zero - to where I wanna be
No one's hero - I do it just for me
Up from zero - it may be hard to do
No one's hero - but you can make it too

Every day I'm a slave to the grind
Think I'm loosing my mind
9 to 5 ain't mu kind of routine
Ain't nobody's machine
Boss says: think of the future
But what about today?
'Cos if I die tomorrow
There ain't no time to waste

I'm leaving
I'm doing my own thing
I'll do it...on my own

Wanna feel I'm alive, I'm a man
Gonna do all I can
Gonna try 'til I get what I need
Never give ups my creed
Make up your mind and do it
And feel you're wild at heart
Life is to short to worry
You've got to make a start

Up from zero - to where I wanna be
No one's hero - I do it just for me
Up from zero - it may be hard to do
No one's hero - but you can make it too


8. Two-Faced

My next-door neighbor
An unassuming man
White picket fences
Respected citizen
In the darkness of hidden passion
In the place that's kept out of view
Raping his teenage daughter softly whispering "I love you"

Look inside: you may find your own de Sade
Thinks you hide, here behind the clean facade

Two-faced creatures - prisoners of the twilight zone
Changing features - contradiction to the bone
Never see eye to eye
Double talk, too many lies
Hypocrites all the way
Doing as we do not see

A loving father
In camouflage concealed
Slaughtering babies
Because their enemies
Butchering in the name of justice
Genocide in the name of peace
"Civilizations" built on blood and bones, when will it cease?

Look inside: do you now your borderline?
Does your self drive a shiver up your spine?

Two-faced creatures - prisoners of the twilight zone
Changing features - contradiction to the bone
Never see eye to eye
Double talk, too many lies
Hypocrites all the way
Doing as we do not see

Our politicians
Leader in wisdom donned
Preach to the masses
And every time they're conned
Slave to greed and servants to power
But the words are honest and pure
The kings of two-facedness reign undisputed and secure

Look inside: would you do it just the same?
What's to hide, everybody plays the game

Two-faced creatures - prisoners of the twilight zone
Changing features - contradiction to the bone
Never see eye to eye
Double talk, too many lies
Hypocrites all the way
Doing as we do not see


9. Ich Brauch Meinen Suff

Ich brauch meinen Suff
wie der Spieße den Puff
Ich brauch meinen Suff
wie der Spieße den Puff

Frühestens ab 2 Promill
weiß ich, was ich wirklich will
dann erst seh ich richtig klar
und scheiß auf das, was vorher war
Mit dem kalten Bier im Blut
kann ich mit jeder wirklich gut
Besoffen auf dem Damenklo
ist jede wie Brigitte Bardot

Ich brauch meinen Suff
wie der Spieße den Puff
Ich brauch meinen Suff
wie der Spieße den Puff

Ich brauch meinen Suff
wie der Spieße den Puff
Ich brauch meinen Suff
wie der Spieße den Puff

Was heißt hier morgen? Lächerlich!
Die Arbeit läuft auch ohne mich
Ich probier jetzt noch die Kleine aus
ich geh nicht ohne Bums nach Haus
Zu vollem Trank brauch ich noch was
und die, die mach ich heut noch nass
und wems nicht passt, der kann jetzt gehen
ich lass jetzt mal die Welt sich drehen, oh ja

Frühestens ab 2 Promill
weiß ich, was ich wirklich will
dann erst seh ich richtig klar
und scheiß auf das, was vorher war
Mit dem kalten Bier im Blut
kann ich mit jeder wirklich gut
Besoffen auf dem Damenklo
ist jede wie Brigitte Bardot

Ich brauch meinen Suff
wie der Spieße den Puff
Ich brauch meinen Suff
Wie der Spieße den Puff


10. Cyberworld

They told us, everything is under control
They told us, there would be no conflict
They told us, they would protect us
But the company lied!
They took our minds and threw them into the matrix-war
As a part of the machine, entering the cyberworld,
There was only one thought left in our heads
To kill!

Voltage rushing into my head
The circuitry - synapse snap
My brain is tuning to a different wave
This mem'ry's nothing but a data save

Virtual reality
Oozing out of my PC
No dividing line
Terrible sublime

C'mon, cyber yourself away - it's the real thing
C'mon, what we you be today - loose the feeling
C'mon, cyber yourself away - minds are reeling
For real

Cyber city, I'm on patrol
My laser gun takes its toll
Among the vermin that is swarming the streets
With two more kills this mission is complete

More than just a game I'm in
Rushing of adrenaline
I'm a real man here
And I know no fear

C'mon, cyber yourself away - it's the real thing
C'mon, what we you be today - loose the feeling
C'mon, cyber yourself away - minds are reeling
For real

Final level, mega-effects
I'm breaking down, nerves are wrecked
Enemy fire has me nearly dead
Final assault, a bullet hits my fead

One last thing I perceive
Is the streets in which I live
Bodies all around
Then I hit the ground

C'mon, cyber yourself away - it's the real thing
C'mon, what we you be today - loose the feeling
C'mon, cyber yourself away - minds are reeling
For real


11. Mainhattan

Hometown, the giant village, big time but little soul
Up! Up! Skyscraper city, business and finance rule

Yuppies make the day
Homebodys take the night

Thugs, drugs, sheer desperation, the streets are full or stripe
Mass life, massive aggression, this place is modern life

Hey! FFM! You are kinda crazy, living here has its own style
Hey! FFM! No time for relaxing, on the edge but never dull

Old ways, still you can find them: weird chesse and apple brew
Old folks, talking the old tongue, tradition coming through

Sports black - and white
Eintracht - we unite

Pubs close, just like a curfew, we told you in a song
Hick town, but always trying to be a metropolis

Hey! FFM! You are kinda crazy, living here has its own style
Hey! FFM! No time for relaxing, on the edge but never dull

Hometown, the giant village, big time but little soul
Up! Up! Skyscraper city, business and finance rule

Yuppies make the day
Homebodys take the night

Thugs, drugs, sheer desperation, the streets are full or stripe
Mass life, massive aggression, this place is modern life

Hey! FFM! You are kinda crazy, living here has its own style
Hey! FFM! No time for relaxing, on the edge but never dull


12. Jimmy B. Bad

I was born in "Dirty Town", early heard the heavy sound
Of pounding drums and loud guitars on the radio
My mama always said to me "Boy it's time for you to see
Life is work, in forty years you'll be a lucky man"

But I was smart and I quit school, started smoking, breaking rules
Bought myself a use guitar in a "Second hand"
My clever brain said "Well Jimmy, you are born to be free
Let the others suck your dick, you're gonna be a star"

Here I go, no more sorrows
Sex, drugs, rock'n'roll is all I want
I just piss on hell and heaven
Meet me on the road, let's have some fun

Fame and money, chart-success, never had a shortage of
Girls, who scared the back of my Firebird T.
My manager just said to me "Boy it's time for you to see
Crazy people don't live long, learn self-control"

I drew my 45 and shot the bastard right between the eyes
They sentenced me to forty years, but I didn't care
My record company was quick and fired me, eat some shit
Are you gonna go my way or follow the blind

Here I go, no more sorrows
Sex, drugs, rock'n'roll is all I want
I just piss on hell and heaven
Meet me on the road, let's have some fun

I ran away, escape the law, beware the lonesome rider
No home, no hope, no alcohol; I'm back on the streets
And then the devil said to me "Boy it's time for you to see
That you're doing well, on the highway to hell

The scales were falling from my eyes, I would have to change my life
Now I understood and knew what to do
I cut my hair and bought myself a noble suit and silken tie
And all the things I did before are legal and okay

Here I go, no more sorrows
Sex, drugs, rock'n'roll is all I want
I just piss on hell and heaven
Meet me on the road, let's have some fun
