"The Tankard" (1995)

1. Grave New World

[Music: O.Zissel]
[Lyrics: T.Clark, A.Bulgaropulos, A.Geremia]

Melt to the beat of the drum
Melt to be one, to be one

What thou wer'st, what thou be
Creature of the hatchery
Not a man reeling free
Bear this mark of destiny

Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta
Is the song that society sings
Soma coma, fucking by numbers
And consume as much as you can

Free from love, free from hate
Sterile and stable
Urge and instinct channeling
Feeling disabled

Pour the genes into the mould
Of what is needed
Engineer conformity
The pool is weeded

[Chorus:]
No more devils, no more heaven
Grave new world
Free and killing or bound and willing
Slave or savage

Dear the calm weighed in souls
But the matter goes untold
What was one man's alone
Multiplies in wretched clones

Endless columns,
mother of sameness
Breeding life in a clinical way
Fear of flowers, learning and playing
For the ones
that are meant to be slaves

Factoried, standardized
Humans conditioned
Play the part
that they're ascribed
No free decision

No More doubt, no more quest
Nothing but answers
Whispered twenty million times
Til all believe them

[Chorus]

We are clay in the hands
Of those who make us
In a vision not our own
Blindfolded robots

God is dead, man is god
Above his fellow
Nothing here's an accident
But you will not know

[Chorus]


2. Minds On The Moon

[Music: A. Katzmann]
[Lyrics: A.Bulgaropulos, A.Geremia]

Nowherebound and without a care
Livin' our lives in a way of "no fear"
Floatin' around in a storm
that blows us away from today

Step on it, baby don't let go
Follow the stupid,
enlighten your soul
See the light,
like an everlasting flame,
burning bright

Every day the same,
madness is the game
It's time for us to hit the road
Money more or less,
sometimes it's a mess
But on and on confusion grows

[Chorus:]
Time keeps spinning in the afternoon
Our minds are up on the moon
In a state of permanent confusion
Life is just an illusion

Nowherebound and without a care
Livin' our lives in a way of "no fear"
Floatin' around in a storm
that blows us away from today

Step on it, baby don't let go
Follow the stupid,
enlighten your soul
See the light,
like an everlasting flame,
burning bright

Every day the same,
loosing our brain
Reality's out of control
Women more or less,
sometimes it's a mess
But on and on confusion grows

[Chorus]


3. The Story Of Mr.Cruel

[Music: A.Bulgaropulos]
[Lyrics: A.Bulgaropulos, A.Geremia]

You have a vision of bloodshed,
my friend
Just go ahead
At the end of the night
No one's gonna ask you why

Eagerly spreading fear
with your hands
Fever in the head
What a gruesome delight
Watching all the people die

Come on, come on
Choose a bomb, there ain't no
No time to lose
It's your private freak show

"Take my hand,
I'll show you the way
To the land of hatred and insanity
Better pray,
"Cruel" is the name they gave me"

[Chorus:]
Sit tight, see it in his face
This game ain't got no rules
Out of the darkest place
This is the story of Mr.Cruel

Sit tight, see it in his face
Don't hope or mercy fools
He's a devil in the skyes
This is the story of Mr.Cruel

Burning down schools,
blowing up airplanes
In the name of war
You're a natural born
Loser on a hellish run

Thousand miles away,
justice in the back
Mass murderer
Politicians don't cry
Money always saves the day

Come on, come on
Choose a bomb, there ain't no
No time to lose
It's your private freak show

"Take my hand...

[Chorus]

You have a vision of bloodshed,
my friend
Just go ahead
At the end of the night
No one's gonna ask you why

"Take my hand...


4. Close Encounter

[Music: A. Katzmann]
[Lyrics: T.Clark, A.Bulgaropulos, A.Geremia]

Picture this: light in the sky
I'm standing on a hill

Not a star, strange kind of glow
Coming down not a mile away

Has it happened? Can it be real?
No reason to fear
Keep it secret, nobody knows
It's our U.F.O.

I see lights, down by the woods
Debris and molten steel
Uniforms barking commands
Tried to run,
but they saw me first

[Chorus:]
Turn away, turn away
Nothing but fear and hate
Is waiting here for you

Turn away, turn away
This is no place to stay
Dissection is your fate

Turn away, turn away
Nothing but fear and hate
Is waiting here for you

I was seized, locked in a truck
And in there, bless my soul
Saw two guys,
wounded, it seemed
Visitors from another world

Has it happened...

Took us to underground labs
In chains like prisoners
They looked with questioning eyes
Did they know we were facing death

[Chorus]

Just like rats they tested them
Subjected them to pain
Wanted their technology
Didn't care for their desperate pleas

They were murdered,
just like the rest:
"Security risk"
I will follow, I only hope
This story will blow


5. Poshor Golovar

[Music: O.Zissel]
[Lyrics: T.Clark, A.Geremia, A.Bulgaropulos]

Fire in his head
world was turning all red
This wall of emotion
crashing down to him
Soul crushed and drowning

Deeper than a wound,
louder than his own scream
Foreign thoughts rushing in
upon his open mind
No way to stop them

The gift of feeling what others feel
The curse that haunts his family
All pain and pleasure unceasingly
Sucked into his identity

(Head of fire -- Poshor golovar)
(Head of fire -- Poshor golovar)
Feelings not of me are eating me
Prisoner of my sensitivity
(Head of fire -- Poshor golovar)
I can never be alone with me
Alcohol, it's my lone relief

[Chorus:]
I will be all of you,
I will drink your souls
I'll be your goodness
and your honesty
I'll be your happiness
and your excessiveness
I'll be your sadness
and your darkest fear
I will be all of you,
I will drink your souls
I'll be your evil and insanity
Your insanity
Your insanity

Hated by the kids,
tasting their rejection
Confused by the power
raging in his mind
No help from outside

Then a bigger shock
when he felt the psych-ward
Madness overwhelming any sanity
Close to the breakdown

The gift of feeling what others feel
The curse that haunts his family
All pain and pleasure unceasingly
Sucked into his identity

(Head of fire...

[Chorus]

Found a higher love,
couldn't get enough of
inside melting into one another now
Deepest fulfillment

Always needing more,
he was like a vampire
Restless,
feeding on the feelings coming on
Lost in the other

The gift of feeling what others feel
The curse that haunts his family
All pain and pleasure unceasingly
Sucked into his identity

(Head on fire...

(Head on fire -- Poshor golovar)
Feelings not of me are eating me
Prisoner of my sensitivity

[Chorus]


6. Mess In The West

[Music: F.Thorwarth]
[Lyrics: T.Clark, A.Bulgaropulos, A.Geremia]

Out in the west, where the coyotes rest
Lives Ed on a dusty little ranch
400 miles from anything that smiles
Just snakes, tumbleweed,
and countro tapes

Barrels in an old mine,
waiting for the right time
Seepage into waterways and wells
"Cactus got a red head
and my chicken all dead,
I got green spots itchin' me like hell"

[Chorus:]
High life in the desert wasteland
There's a big mess in the west
Dioxin or heavy metal
It's a big mess in the west
Dump now you'll be payin' later
For the big mess in the west

"FUCK Inc., preaches ecology"
Boss smiles, holding up recycled cup
But in the night, when evil's out of site
His waste goes on west and disappears

Meanwhile in the distance,
Ed is kinda' pissed and
All his cows are growing funny horns
Ed is losing his hair,
and he's full of despair
"Christ Almighty, everything is wrong!"

[Chorus]

Out in the west, where the coyotes rest
Lived Ed on a dusty little ranch
400 miles from anything that smiles
Just snakes, tumbleweed,
and country tapes

Ed was taken east
and noone ever missed him
Had no kids, no relatives, no wife
Then he was dissected,
data were corrected
But they won't be published on hour life

[Chorus]


7. Atomic Twilight

[Music: A.Bulgaropulos]
[Lyrics: A.Bulgaropulos, A.Geremia]

Today it is quiet and peaceful
Year 2045, life in the domes is easy
Hermetically sealed,
keeping mankind alive

The outer regions are poisoned
The radiation's high
Ashes and dust are falling
Deadly heat, the planet is dry

[Chorus:]
Hellish days, toxic and infectious times
Atomic twilight outside
Nuclear gods, you brought us here
Dragging our would into fear
Hellish days, atomic twilight outside

It started just by testing
Some new technologies
Providing peace and balance
Back in those years
it did sound good to me

Now with the memories fading
I can't remember too well
But jealousy in our hearts
Wiped out reason, security failed

[Chorus]

I went out again this evening
To watch the violet night
But my blind eyes don't see anything
Time is up, I feel the cancer inside


8. Fuck Christmas

[Music: A.Ratzmann]
[Lyrics: M.Kipness, A.Bulgaropulos, A.Geremia]

Christmas time is here again
Time to give your cash to them
At the cross is where we'll meet
Leaving presents at his feet
Buy your gifts in harmony
Feed the Christmas industry

[Chorus:]
Fuck Christmas! All the time
Now I've got my yuletide pride!
Fuck Christmas! All the time
I've got Jesus on my side!
Fuck Christmas! Fuck Christmas!
Fuck Christmas! All the time!

Jesus came and Jesus went
Look at all the cash we spent
Mother Mary you will see
Never bought a Christmas tree
Christmas is for me and me
I give only to receive

[Chorus]

Christmas time is here again ...

[Chorus]

He was fuckin' born in August anyway ...


9. Positive

[Music: A.Bulgaropulos]
[Lyrics: T.Clark, A.Bulgaropulos, A.Geremia]

Deep in the gut, deep inside of me
There it is, everywhere
Look at me go, watch it grow
Into my place

Couldn't find myself in the mirror today
Who's that fading face? Oh, no!
Waiting for the one that'll blow me away
Rollercoaster rides, oh, no!

[Chorus]
Tell me what you see when you look at me
Is it more than my HIV?
Tell me what you see when you look at me
Is it more?

Dying weaves quilts of sympathy
Cover me, cover me!
Feeble and blind, weak and dazed
Lover hold me tight

Couldn't see a thing in the mirror today
Tell me that's your name? Oh yeah!
Waiting for the one that'll blow me away
Full blown all the way, oh no!

[Chorus]

Blood and tears shed for years and years
Will it end, will it end?
This is a war, hope, despair
Battle every day

Can you see yourself in the mirror today?
Tell me, what's your name? Oh yeah!
I can see my face and I know this is me
I'm not giving up myself

[Chorus]


10. Hope?

[Music: O.Zissel]
[Lyrics: M.Kipness, A.Bulgaropulos, A.Geremia]

Even Then I try to look the problem in the eyes
There's no hope for me in sight

Stagnant though I am there's a spark
which keeps me moving on
Yet - there's no hope for me in sight

It's alright - 'cos I know I will win this fight

Me decline
this is what I've come to
Wasted time
Living day by day
My decline
Lost my zeal and inner strength
Wasted time
Now it's time to pay

Never set my goals
and my gears are all stuck in reverse
There's no hope for me in sight

Life has passed me by
and the dreams seem unattainable
There's no hope for me in sight

It's alright - 'cos I know I will win this fight

My decline ...

Even Then I try to look the problem in the eyes
There's no hope for me in sight

There's no hope for me in sight
There's no hope for me in sight

My decline ...

There's no hope for me in sight
There's no hope for me in sight
