"Thirst" (2008)

1. Octane Warriors

Roads deserted, and motors run cold
Civilization in lack of black gold
Nationwide the engines stand still
Energy crisis, we're paying the bill

Year 2060
No fuel means war
The world is in upheaval
All empty reservoirs
OPEC embargoes
Inflation's high
Refineries not working
And politicians lie

I'm trying to survive
Out in the desert wastelands
My memories are fading
How peaceful life once was

Chasing down highways
No food, just guns
Society is crumbling
So many on the run

[Chorus:]
Welcome to the oil-wars!
Welcome to the oil-wars! No flame - no game!
Welcome Octane Warriors!
Making our own laws - in high octane!

Gangs of marauders
Fight bloody fights
For gasoline and diesel
Mankind trapped in the night

I'm trying to survive
Out in the desert wastelands
My memories are fading
How peaceful life once was

Billions of barrels
The Saudis lost
Nobody can eat money
Greed causes higher costs

[Chorus:]
Welcome to the oil-wars!
Welcome to the oil-wars! No flame - no game!
Welcome Octane Warriors!
Making our own laws - in high octane!

Roads deserted, and motors run cold
Civilization in lack of black gold
Nationwide the engines stand still
Energy crisis, we-re paying the bill

Year 2060
No fuel means war
The world is in upheaval
All empty reservoirs

[Chorus:]
Welcome to the oil-wars!
Welcome to the oil-wars! No flame - no game!
Welcome Octane Warriors!
Making our own laws - in high octane!
Welcome to the oil-wars!
Welcome to the oil-wars! No flame - no game!
Welcome Octane Warriors!
Making our own laws - in high octane!


2. Deposit Pirates

Sailing the alley, black scarf round my head
My old shopping-trolley heels close to the wind
Limping the gutter on my wooden limb
Smelling of whisky, rum, beer and gin

I hunt for treasures
Wherever treasures may be found
Don't look for diamonds
There's a greater prize just lying around

Approaching the waste bin, my hook held up high
I'll board this vessel if I live or die
To get all those bottles treasured within
The waste dump sounds with my battle-cry:

[Chorus:]
Deposit Pirates at bay!
Deliver your empties and pray!
Fight for your flasks, fight for your cans -
Deposit Pirates at bay!
Fight for your flasks, fight for your cans -
Deliver your empties and pray!

Kissing my brides at the Kiosks around
I lift my eye-patch, twinkling steal their refunds
My Jolly Roger's crossed bottles and jar
Winds toss my black wig - I must go on

I hunt for treasures
Wherever treasures may be found
Don't look for diamonds
There's a greater prize just lying around

[Chorus:]
Deposit Pirates at bay!
Deliver your empties and pray!
Fight for your flasks, fight for your cans -
Deposit Pirates at bay!
Fight for your flasks, fight for your cans -
deliver your empties and pray!

The conquest is over, the sun's hanging low
I sail with the tide: now I've got to go
My chauffeur picks me up in my limousine
I'm master, commander, fund-saver and mean

[Chorus:]
Deposit Pirates at bay!
Deliver your empties and pray!
Fight for your flasks, fight for your cans -
Deposit Pirates at bay!
Fight for your flasks, fight for your cans -
deliver your empties and pray!


3. Stay Thirsty!

Once I was a young boy
Ready to explode
Sister was my idol
Out there on the road

She didn't want me
To be satisfied

"Stay alone and hungry"
She was singing loud
Blinded by her lipstick
Following the crowd

Dee never showed me
How to feel alright

Confusion! Confusion!
I could not find some friends
But then my eyes did open
My conclusion? Disillusion!

You can keep your make-up!
Stupid curly clown!
Keep your stretchy pants, you're
Twisted to the bone!

Now I'm a free man
Weakness is my strength

Stay thirsty! Stay thirsty!
That's what life's all about
No fighting, no burning
We drinkers hang around

[Chorus:]
Stay thirsty! Stay thirsty!
Let the beer flow - Stay thirsty!
Liquid nation - Stay thirsty!

Sitting on my sofa
Crying 'bout the past
I'm so fat and lazy
Affluence my ass!

Bring back the 80s
Wildness, sex and bite

Infusion! Infusion!
That's what I need today
To hell with idle lifestyle
The solution? Retrogression!

See me and my buddies
Move from pub to pub
Stretchy pants and lipstick
Sisters never stop!

We blend the old days
With some booze and fun

Stay thirsty! Stay thirsty!
That's what life's all about
No fighting, no burning
We drinkers hang around

[Chorus:]
Stay thirsty! Stay thirsty!
Let the beer flow - Stay thirsty!
Liquid nation - Stay thirsty!

[Chorus:]
Stay thirsty! Stay thirsty!
Let the beer flow - Stay thirsty!
Liquid nation - Stay thirsty!
Stay thirsty! Stay thirsty!
Let the beer flow - Stay thirsty!
Liquid nation - Stay thirsty!


4. Hyperthermia

It's my vacation
I'm leaving soon
A trip to Finland
On a sunny afternoon

Helsinki-Airport
Straight out of town
I'll drive through woodlands
And relax a week alone

Nature - my cottage is waiting
A lake on the countryside
Rumours - the natives are talking
Of legends that come here to life

I need a steam bath in the old Finnish ways
I want to sweat, up to a hundred degrees

[Chorus:]
Heat up the stove!
The sauna is cleansing my body and mind
Water on stones, a mystical place
Beware of hyperthermia
Heat up the stove!
The dead has been washed here in ancient times
Bodies and bones, I'm crazy in haze
My vision: hyperthermia!

Help me! Somebody's in here
And temperature's rising high
Jamming! The door doesn't open
The dead rise to burn me alive!

I know this evil's real, that this is no dream
My flesh is scorching, I can hear myself scream!

[Chorus:]
Heat up the stove!
The sauna is cleansing my body and mind
Water on stones, a mystical place
Beware of hyperthermia
Heat up the stove!
The dead has been washed here in ancient times
Bodies and bones, I'm crazy in haze
My vision: hyperthermia!

Stuck in hellfire
Near Helsinki
Years later I'm still here
My soul never will be free

Must find a victim
Some stupid fool
Who takes a steam bath
On a sunny afternoon

I need a steam bath in the old Finnish ways
I want to sweat, up to a hundred degrees

[Chorus:]
Heat up the stove!
The sauna is cleansing my body and mind
Water on stones, a mystical place
Beware of hyperthermia
Heat up the stove!
The dead has been washed here in ancient times
Bodies and bones, I'm crazy in haze
My vision: hyperthermia!


5. Echoes Of Fear

Burning houses, some distant screams of pain
Burning people, painful and cruelly slain

I'm dashing to my chair
I have a few fried beans
Some scrambled eggs
Some bread or toast

While I watch far-off people roast
It's in the Morning-News
I'm trying to find my shoes
An airplane crashed
Explosion flashed
I have to carry out the trash!

[Chorus:]
Echoes of a distant battle!
Echoes of fear!
Echoes of a distant battle!
Still another beer?
Echoes of a distant battle!
Echoes!
Echoes of a distant battle!
Have another beer!

I'm on my way to work
I watch some well-dressed clerk
Being robbed by some
Unscrupulous bum
But as I'm late I hurry on

At noon I'm out to lunch
But as a silly bunch
Of Punks beats up
A nice old chap
I got to hurry for my cab

[Chorus:]
Echoes of a distant battle!
Echoes of fear!
Echoes of a distant battle!
Still another beer?
Echoes of a distant battle!
Echoes!
Echoes of a distant battle!
Have another beer!

Burning houses, some distant screams of pain
Burning people, painful and cruelly slain

I cuddle to my couch
I nibble some more chips
The TV shows
Some other's woes
But that's the way that this world goes!

And so I went to bed
I had one final fag
The fire-brigade
Was much too late
The neighbourhood would hesitate

[Chorus:]
Echoes of a distant battle!
Echoes of fear!
Echoes of a distant battle!
Still another beer?
Echoes of a distant battle!
Echoes!
Echoes of a distant battle!
Have another beer!


6. When Daddy Comes To Play

One single room
One iron door
500 square feet are my whole world that I do abhor
No natural light
No window-pane
24 years of dungeon nearly drove my mind insane

Boil with rage or burn with shame?
I hardly can decide
The evil has a loving face
The evil has no sense of grace
Evil took my life away
Evil comes tonight

I cant describe the terror that creeps along my spine
A beep precedes the door's release
When Daddy comes to play
I can't deny the easing that raises up my mind
A beep precedes the door's release
When Daddy comes to play

This is my life
You think it's low
At least I had the chance to see some
Of my children grow
No seed of love
A seed of pain
But still we all are creatures living on his worst disdain

Boil with rage or burn with shame?
I hardly can decide
The evil has a loving face
The evil has no sense of grace
Evil took my life away
Evil comes tonight

I cant describe the terror that creeps along my spine
A beep precedes the door's release
When Daddy comes to play
I can't deny the easing that raises up my mind
A beep precedes the door's release
When Daddy comes to play

Daddy comes and we are singing
He will bring some toys to play
Daddy comes and we are dancing
To his words we will obey

Daddy comes and we are singing
He will bring some toys to play

Daddy comes and we are dancing
To his words we will obey
Someone's knocking outside
Somebody's at the door
Something's breaking inside
Some thing did break before

Someone's knocking outside
Somebody's at the door
Something's breaking inside
Some thing did break before

Daddy comes and we are singing
He will bring


7. Zodiac Man

Some call me tight lipped
Taciturn guy
Some maybe call me weirdo
Absent most of the time

Now here's my story
The awful truth
I am no silent dreamer
And surely not confused

It all started in my childhood many years ago
Gazing at the night sky through my brand new telescope
Suddenly I saw a secret glowing in the stars
No one did believe me, parents, friends, astronomers

But the stellar constellation
Charged my brain with cosmic rays
I was like a huge receiver
For the lights from deeper space

[Chorus:]
I am the Zodiac Man
There are things beyond the planet rings you won't believe
When I use my powers there's an eclipse of the sun
I'm the Zodiac Man

Soon I felt my supernatural abilities
Reading thoughts and sensing all the human energies
Shifting weather, earthquakes by the powers of my mind
Even spin the moon depending on celestial signs

Observation of the heaven
Everything's at my control
Guiding asteroids, solar winds and
Distant galaxy black holes

[Chorus:]
I am the Zodiac Man
There are things beyond the planet rings you won't believe
When I use my powers there's an eclipse of the sun
I'm the Zodiac Man

Chosen one! Am I good or bad?
Chosen one! This burden makes me mad
Chosen one! Earth, I have to leave
Chosen one! The stars are my relief
Some call me tight lipped
Taciturn guy

Some maybe call me weirdo
Absent most of the time

Now here's my story
The awful truth
I am no silent dreamer
And surely not confused

[Chorus:]
I am the Zodiac Man
There are things beyond the planet rings you won't believe
When I use my powers there's an eclipse of the sun
I'm the Zodiac Man
I am the Zodiac Man
There are things beyond the planet rings you won't believe
I am the Zodiac Man
When I use my powers there's an eclipse of the sun


8. G.A.L.O.W.

In early days of history
The earth was young and wild
And still the Greek mythology
Brings olden times to life

Black the sky
The ground was shaking
When Titans walked the land
Blood and cries
The gods were raging
When they took dominance

In songs of epic poetry
Old hero-tales were placed
The writers of the Aegean Sea
Been kissed by Muse's grace

[Chorus:]
Gods and Legends of War
The Ancients were yelling: "Glory and fame!"
Olympus is waiting, immortal halls
Gods and Legends of War
Gods and Legends of War
The Ancients were yelling: "Glory and fame!"
Olympus is waiting, immortal halls
Gods and Legends of War

Prometheus stole heaven's fire
And brought it to mankind
In anger Zeus chained him to rocks
To punish for this crime

Black the sky
Of deadly arrows
When Persia came to Greece
Blood and cries
The Spartan warriors
They killed with swords and spears

See Jason and the Argonauts
Ulysses, bravest king
Medusa, Troy and Minotaur
Enchanting Sirens sing

[Chorus:]
Gods and Legends of War
The Ancients were yelling: "Glory and fame!"
Olympus is waiting, immortal halls
Gods and Legends of War
Gods and Legends of War
The Ancients were yelling: "Glory and fame!"
Olympus is waiting, immortal halls
Gods and Legends of War

In early days of history
The earth was young and wild
And still the Greek mythology
Brings olden times to life

[Chorus:]
Gods and Legends of War
The Ancients were yelling: "Glory and fame!"
Olympus is waiting, immortal halls
Gods and Legends of War
Gods and Legends of War
The Ancients were yelling: "Glory and fame!"
Olympus is waiting, immortal halls
Gods and Legends of War


9. Myevilfart

Hey boss! Your Party's cool
Another year so let's start drinking
Excess! The alcohol flows
Your birthday is a night for sinners

My bladder's full
Need to take a killer piss now
I can't, can't hardly walk
Gotta find a wall to mark now

I went to pee, and passed some gas
My rectum is evil, I've just burnt my ass

[Chorus:]
My evil fart!! Methane is a form of might
In the burning flame of power!! My evil fart
My evil fart!! Methane is a form of might
In the burning flame of power!! My evil fart

Here comes my friend
With a raging pole to empty
Nice, right next to me
Wretched wind right up his nostril

My friend got sick, he had to puke
My ass had the power, it wasn't a fluke

[Chorus:]
My evil fart!! Methane is a form of might
In the burning flame of power!! My evil fart
My evil fart!! Methane is a form of might
In the burning flame of power!! My evil fart

The job was done
I went back home really happy
Still unable to walk
Hit the hay but then I blew more

People-a lesson learned
A lot of beers and you'll start stinking
Eat beans-and that's how it goes
Make people spew and be a winner

[Chorus:]
My evil fart!! Methane is a form of might
In the burning flame of power!! My evil fart
My evil fart!! Methane is a form of might
In the burning flame of power!! My evil fart


10. Sexy Feet Under

I am a normal guy
I'm working at a store for footwear
I love my wife and child
Our peaceful town and Sunday prayers

But when the night falls
I'm turning into Hyde
Indulge my kinky interests
In search for female tights
Women in lace and leather
With high stiletto heels
No pussy-odor!
Just sexy, slender feet

Your legs are heavens gateway
For me it's leading down

[Chorus:]
Under your feet!
Under your feet! I'm licking your toes!
Under your feet!
Under your feet! I'm kissing your shoes!

Footjob! I am her slave!
She's rubbing my big cock so rudely
Beat me! Oh Domina!
I'm only worth of being trampled

I kneel before her
Giving a pedicure
And treatments of submission
Like licking, that's for sure
Massaging, even smelling
She's lifting her disguise
During orgasm
I see she's my own wife

Your legs are heavens gateway
For me it's leading down

[Chorus:]
Under your feet!
Under your feet! I'm licking your toes!
Under your feet!
Under your feet! I'm kissing your shoes!
High horny heels! High Heels!
High horny heels! My mistress awaits!
High horny heels! High Heels!
High horny heels! In nylon I dream!

Your legs are heavens gateway
For me it's leading down

[Chorus:]
Under your feet!
Under your feet! I'm licking your toes!
Under your feet!
Under your feet! I'm kissing your shoes!
High horny heels! High Heels!
High horny heels! My mistress awaits!
High horny heels! High Heels!
High horny heels! In nylon I dream!
